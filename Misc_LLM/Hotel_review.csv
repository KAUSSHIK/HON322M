We stayed in a room with a river view and it was absolutely amazing. We went up to the rooftop bar and the view from our room was actually better. We found the rooftop to be overpriced and felt very touristy as opposed to people staying in the hotel. The room itself was spacious and clean, loved the robes. Unfortunately it had a door to adjoin the room next door and the couple next door had a late night argument that sounded like it was in our room. However, the location of the hotel is perfect for River Walk activities as well as walking up Michigan Ave for shopping. We ate in two of the restaurants in the hotel and were happy with them. There is no business center and I sat in the lobby in the early morning to do some work and it was a bit noisy and crowded. Overall, highly recommend.",5.0,5.0,5.0,,,,August 2021,,98,79.0

After reaching out to the reservations desk at the LondonHouse, I got in touch with Manny, who provided detailed information on how their rooftop proposal package works. I reserved an hour on their rooftop where roses, a bottle of Dom Perignon, and flameless candles would await my unsuspecting girlfriend. Manny also arranged for a professional photographer, Lindsay, and a musician to play Hanging by a Moment for us (the background for that song and our relationship probably doesn’t save the fact that it’s cliché as heck). A few weeks before the proposal, Manny called me and explained exactly how this would go down, specifically how we would be escorted to the rooftop while he chatted with us under the guise that we were having “drinks on the rooftop”. When we arrived, everything went incredibly smoothly - exactly as Manny described. The shock and surprise on her face when she realized what was happening is something that I’ll absolutely treasure for a long time to come. After the proposal, Lindsay stayed with us for about 30-45 minutes to take pictures. She was absolutely wonderful and made sure to get all of the photos we felt we needed. After spending a few more minutes alone, Manny brought us down to the hotel restaurant on the 21st floor where he had made a reservation for us. In all, the whole experience from start to finish was simply excellent. There are cheaper ways to pop the question (the whole thing with the reservation, musician, and photographer ran close to $3,000), but the once-in-a-lifetime question deserves an experience to match. And that’s what I got.",,,,,,,October 2021,Traveled as a couple,1,

Don't stay anywhere else!,"I've traveled all around the world and this is by far the best hotel experience I have had. My now wife and I  stayed at the LondonHouse for four nights recently for our wedding which took place at the top of the LondonHouse Rooftop and it was made so special from all of the staff that we had a chance to connect with during our time there. From the moment of check inn, Nicole and Arturo at the front desk were so great to my wife and I. Friendly and knowledgeable, they made it feel very welcoming upon arrival. Had a few packages waiting for me upon arrival which security brought right up to the room and no issues even though the packages arrived a few days before we did. We had a vista room which was extremely clean and had a stunning floor to ceiling window overlooking the river. The room has everything you need and is perfect for a couple. Housekeeping was very nice and still made the beds everyday which is something we have not seen in the many hotels we have stayed in since COVID. No issues with the room at all.The Rooftop Restaurant and Bar was excellent. The empanadas are something we have not shut up about since we have come home. Between the view, the food, and music, it is impossible to not have a good time at the rooftop.Now to the two people that made the stay so special. There are no words to describe how special  Mary (the concierge) and Manny (who manages the rooftop ) made the experience for us. With an elopement, we didn't expect to have any family or friends at our special day, but little did we know that these two great people would became a part of our extended family during our time there.  Mary and I made a friendship connection before our stay as she helped me with a very tough to get reservation at Gibsons Italia for our wedding night. When I arrived at the hotel it was like meeting a friend you haven't seen in a while and were extremely happy to see. With her very warming and helpful disposition, she helped my wife and I who had never been to Chicago feel like we knew everything we needed to know about the city. She went above and beyond to make us feel like family during our time there and even surprised us with a very special flower and card on our wedding day which has since been framed and hung in our home. Manny was another person who we made a connection with before our arrival as he was the one who helped us book the rooftop location and set us up for the best day ever. He went above and beyond all day to making us feel as though we just had to enjoy the day with zero stress. He even ran back to the room for us when we forgot out wedding certificate to sign! He made my wife feel like a true princess that day and made her feel so special, I am forever thankful to him for that. He was engaging to talk to and just a truly wonderful soul to get to know over our time there. I could write about these two forever, but if you have the chance to meet them on your stay, you will be better off for it. The views from the rooftop and hotel amenities  are second to none in the city, but the people who work here are what will forever make it special to us. Thanks to everyone, you are truly the best!",,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,September 2021,,1,1.0

The gentleman that checked us in at the front desk upgraded us from $12 dollar vouchers for breakfast to $20 dollar vouchers because it was our first time staying at the London House. We stayed on the 15th floor in a king room overlooking the river. The view of the river is amazing. The room was small but perfect for our needs. The room had a small smart fridge and a large flat screen TV.  The room had a good sized bathroom with shower. The beds are fairly comfortable. The elevators here are fast. We didn’t hear anyone in adjacent rooms. We had breakfast at the downstairs restaurant Land and Lake. We waited about 15 minutes at 8:45am. The food was great. The service was awesome.

He was responsive throughout the 12 months between booking Londonhouse and our wedding date, was organized throughout the process, and was proactive in reaching out to both my wife and I to keep us up to date and keep the stress levels low.

I did not get to use the fitness center or spa.We checked into our room, 1021 on the 10th Floor. The elevator system worked well except when it was a very busy night on the rooftop. They would take some elevators out of service to service just the rooftop. As far as the room, we found it to be very clean and overall a simply stellar experience. The bathroom was beautiful. We loved the little touches like the artwork above the bed, the decor on the shelf next to the bed, the Nespresso machine, the robes/slippers in the closet, etc. We just overall liked the design and decor -- not to mention the view as I mentioned above.We tried both the Rooftop for drinks on Friday, September 3 with a reservation at 10pm as well as Land & Lake on five occasions. We had breakfast here each morning, as well as lunch our arrival day and happy hour on one day.Land & Lake got very busy later in the morning; however, I feel that the staff was always very friendly and efficient. The food came out quickly, and I thought it was good quality at a decent price. Overall a 5/5 on Land & Lake.The Rooftop had great views.  We had a reservation at 10pm on Friday night. We had a reserved table when we arrived, which was nice; however, I think they need to limit people visiting to only reservations or only parties for which they have a table. We had a few issues; however, they were quickly remedied by the staff. Overall, it was a beautiful evening and would return again. I would recommend possibly considering adding doors to the ice machine area during a future renovation, as they can get a little loud at times. However, we appreciated the location closer to the machine and elevator.

If you are lucky you will get the best views of the city. Other than the spectacular view the room was nice; small and clean. We were early for checkin and when we asked if we could wait in lobby bar, staff had ‘no idea’ if it was open. As a resident of this hotel, expect to pay 4-5 star prices for a 3 star service. The hotel is popular for weddings so expect chaos at the elevator daily and long queues to the reception desk. The 21st floor restaurant is booked out weeks (upon weeks) in advance. You can enjoy a drink on the 22nd floor terrace but expect to stand at the bar as all tables are reserved (despite being told there are no reservations for the bar). Lastly we had a very unfortunate experience on the rooftop bar. We found a table that was not reserved. There were no staff around so we asked the patrons around us and none of the other people there had reserved their table. So we assumed it was ok and sat down. At one point we found  a gentleman working there and asked if there was table service. He advised that he did not know as it looked like it may rain (?) and staff were sent downstairs.  We made use of the bar and brought the drinks back to our table. At one point a waitress appeared and literally took a seat from behind one of the ladies in our party. When I asked why she said ‘you have been using the bar and do not have a reservation’. Privately,  my partner asked her why our table in particular had been targeted, she advised it was because we did not ask for table service. Note earlier we had been advised it may not be available. I usually feel that as a resident in a hotel you are the highest priority, not the case in this hotel unfortunately. The porters in this hotel are the only positive service experience I had with hotel staff.  Chicago is a wonderful, vibrant city; if you expect a friendly haven after hectic days of sightseeing/shopping, choose your hotel carefully.",,,,,,,September 2021,Traveled as a couple,22,6.0

The rooms are incredibly small and to make up for it the drawers are under the bed. Street noise is pretty loud despite good windows — not their fault — because cars and motorcycles without mufflers race up and down all night. Then there’s the ambulance sirens.  Not a restful spot. Never mind trying to get a reservation at the rooftop bar. Thanks to revelers the hotel has a rough edge on weekends.Hilton seems to have abandoned the business class hotel market in Chicago.  Homewood Suites and Hampton’s abound. On the upper end the Waldorf is great but expensive and the Hilton Chicago is old.

Hotel is perfectly positioned to walk to the main tourist attractions. I will say for anyone with a Trump sensibility that it is located right opposite Trump tower with his name written in HUGE letters on the front. So any river facing rooms actually face the tower head-on and that is your view with the river off to the left. Not worth the upgrade money if you’d prefer not to see that. We switched to a city room which is a view of other buildings and still some river view. Staff are great. Beds are very, very  comfortable. Rooms are quiet and spotlessly clean. Bathroom could be more private due to a sliding door. I’d like to see the hotel instigate some eco-friendly steps as right now there is seemingly nothing happening with that.

Our two double room was spacious enough and had everything we needed. The view of the river was nice, although marred by the large ""Trump"" sign opposite us. The elevators are multiple and fast! The hotel is just a block away from Michigan Avenue if you're into shopping. We had dinner at an Irish pub a block away - there weren't a lot of close restaurant choices nearby, but the pub was good. It was a little price, but it is on the river. You can save $100 bucks or so a night by staying a few blocks away. But my daughter had never stayed on the river and really enjoyed the vibe.

Everything was perfect and on point. The decor set up was great, exactly the way I wanted. LH is very signature of chicago where you have magnificent view of lake, river as well as amazing architecture of Chicago.

The view of the Chicago River and the city's skyline is stunningly framed in the ballroom's floor to ceiling windows, giving our wedding the true Chicago glitz and one of a kind view. The staff at the LondonHouse went above and beyond the call of duty on so many occasions throughout the planning process. Steve took so much stress out of planning a wedding during pandemic, and was patient and accommodating with all of our questions and concerns, putting us at ease every step of the way. He was incredible full stop. Emails and phone calls were always answered in under 24 hours, and his attention to detail eliminated any stress that one could experience when planning a wedding. The professionalism of the hotel staff as a whole was impressive as well. All of our guests commented on how beautiful the hotel was as well as how friendly and helpful the staff was. Our guests were also impressed by the quality and delightfulness of the food served at our reception, it was delicious and the chefs deserve the highest of compliments for their delectable creations during the cocktail hour and dinner courses.

Reservations promised me a king suite with a pull-out sofa. When I showed up at the location, that was not the case (it was just a solo king)) obviously that didn’t work!! Heading to the counter, Bess you was there to greet me! Bess hooked me up with a double unit—I was accepting of this flexibility! Sadly, that was only good for 1 night. On the next day, I was transferred to the work of Grace—manger on duty at the time—who was there; there was some hiccups between ‘reservations promises’, and what they had to offer. Grace worker diligently to rectify this miscommunication!! She was able to cross-tie my original reservation to one that accommodated multiple parties!!! I was thrilled!! [I later learned that Grace was moving from this location to a different establishment!!!]Grace took amazing care of us. We went downstairs to the Land @ Lake Kitchen for breakfast. There we meet Sergio. To this moment; I do not know if Sergio is still working there—but if he is, it is still worth the wait to make sure he takes care of you!! Between the culinary genius which is in the kitchen, and the attentive customer centric wait/staff that is taking care of you—‘Sergio’ is the perfect mesh! The blend between cuisine and service is married beautifully between Sergio and Chef! It’s a shame the London House is loosing out on Grace at the counter, but I hope to all those who are reading this that Sergio is still there!I am excepting of my experience—and hope all receive the same, or better!!",,,,,,,July 2021,Traveled with friends,1,

After some deal searching I was able to score a corner suite for less than the cost of a standard double and it was worth the time and scouring for the upgrade. Hotel location is good though Main Street rooms can get a bit noisy at night. But it’s the city. You need to just go in knowing this. Corner suite was lovely filled with tall windows that all opened a bit for some fresh air. The tv was absolutely massive in front of the bed though. The bathroom was very large and shower was excellent in temperature and pressure. Amenities in bathroom smelled great and included a shower poof and —ladies, get this- a hair tie too! (I cannot stress how often we long-haired people are searching for a hair tie.)All windows had two sets of shades: one light filtering and one blackout. The windows are extraordinarily tall so having these motorized would have been nice. Also the bathroom needs something other than all shade or nothing. It’s the only one without a sheet curtain which is odd because that’s perfect for daytime. The entire hotel smells good. Excellent scent that isn’t overpowering but sets a nice tone. This is continued through the use of quality bathroom products. My only one real gripe is that the heating/ A/C is unforgivably loud. Ridiculously loud. Turned-it-off-and-lived-with-sweating-in-June loud. (And then promptly cranked it to 65 anytime I left the room.)For reference this hotel is about 1.3 miles from Union Station ($10-15 ride share) and is steps away from Michigan Ave, Tribune building and some other hot spots.",,,,,,,June 2021,Traveled solo,20,5.0

Paloma (manager): 5 out of 5Front desk: 2 out of 5 Housekeeping: 0 out of 5Location: 5 out of 5 Or who Is sent up to your room￼, this is a 5 star or 1 star hotel. My final rating was a compromise between the twoIn terms of location and cleanliness, this is definitely 5 stars. You are right across from the Riverwalk, close to Millennium Park  and the views from the suite are impressive. Tons of restaurants and shopping within walking distanceNow back to the customer service issue. To say it’s “hit or miss” is an understatement of the century. Some examples:1) I called the front desk the first night and ask them to pull out the sofa bed and have it prepared for children. (Ie put down sheets and pillows etc. I have requested this several times at other hotels and never had an issue￼The person who answered the phone asked if the bed was “stuck” and I said no, I just needed someone to come and pull out the bed and put sheets and pillowcases down while we were out. He replied ￼that was not possible given Covid but they could leave the sheets and pillows outside. Although I was frustrated I said fine and hung up. Then I recalled that I requested daily housekeeping services and inevitably someone will have to come to the room to turn down the bed, change out sheets etc. and obviously Covid was not preventing that. I called back and presented this information to a different representative and she said “ of course we can help with that “ and she took care of it.2) That same night I called the front desk and said we were having issues with their air-conditioning specifically there was no ventilation in the entry room and the AC was blowing hot air above 67°￼. The technician who came up basically said there was nothing he could do for us and the only thing to do was to leave the bedroom door open to let airflow through the suite. The next day the situation became even worse and anytime we tried to set the thermostat above 65 we got hot air blowing into the room. I called and another technician came up And I told him the previous technician said he could not do anything for us. He quickly adjusted some settings and vents and miraculously the problem was fixed.3) i called the Front desk And requested to borrow a pair of scissors and was told that I would have to come down to the front desk because “no one was available to bring it up”. I’ve traveled to over 50 countries and stayed at some of the nicest and most expensive hotels in the world and everything in between and never heard of such nonsense. At the very worst I’ve been told that it may take a while or someone will be up as soon as possible but never been told that they simply can’t send someone up￼.Another issue that I ran into was depending on what time you call you could be waiting 10’or 20 or 30 minutes or longer until someone actually picks up at the front desk. Sometimes there’s just an automated voice prompt that says they’re too busy to take your call and the call disconnects. again having stayed at many many hotels all over the world I’ve never encountered this￼ phenomenon.If not for the issues with customer service or lack there of this would definitely be a five star establishment all the way. Some of the personnel in this hotel needs to be terminated immediately because they definitely in the wrong profession if answering questions are providing assistance is an inconvenience or annoyance.Another issue which other reviewer’s have mentioned is there is a large amount of foot traffic through the hotel and entrance to the elevators due to the Numerous restaurants and bars surrounding the hotel. On numerous occasions we passed drunk or puking bar patrons or dogs taking a dump on the carpet right outside the hotel entrance. There is another entrance to the hotel which seems to bypass a lot of this “outside” foot traffic but inexplicably it is closedPaloma, Who I believe is a front desk supervisor or a manager reached out to me and was very generous with her time and I think attempted to address Several of the issues i raised in my review while I was still at the hotel. Unfortunately many of those things  did not get better but actually got worse. A few examples:1) After a day out we came back to the room and basically half of the room had Not even been touched or cleaned by housekeeping. My mother who was  in a different suite  had similar complaints about the consistency of service￼  or Complete lack thereof so I know it was not an isolated incident. I immediately called the front desk and ask someone to come by and fix up the room properly once we left and when we returned from dinner they basically had left the blankets and pillows on the bed for us to put down ourselves￼. This was after I specifically requested someone to actually make up the bed and change out the comforter while we were out. This occurred many times during the stay where I would ask housekeeping to come up and actually service the room and they would say they could not since we were in the suite but even after we left nothing was actually serviced it was usually left for us to do ourselves. Never seen this before. 2) I called and asked the front desk if they had a screwdriver I could use and was told that they did not have one I could borrow. The next morning on the way down to breakfast I asked someone at the front desk and they said they had a screwdriver and within two minutes a friendly  engineer came by and helped me for the 10 seconds that I needed. Again just complete lack of consistency in terms of customer service. Paloma And several of the front desk team members were very friendly and helpful but I would say at least 50% of the time the person who answered the phone sounded annoyed or bothered that I was even calling them. I definitely think an overhaul is needed especially for the front desk team and I am just not someone who is anal or Uber picky about things as you can see from the many reviews and the variety of establishments I have stayed out all over the world￼Given the issues with customer service I would not recommend staying at this establishment and would return to The Gwen which I thoroughly enjoyed during my first visit to Chicago.

We checked in early and were offered an upgrade with a view that was ready.  We took it.  We had a good river view which we enjoyed.  The beds were very comfortable, perhaps a little soft, but pretty good, lots of pillows.  The bathroom was very pretty with a large shower and even a make up mirror.  The room had a Nespresso coffee maker which came with a few pods and also a tea bag to let you know you can just heat water in it also.  Waking up to a nice hot cup of coffee in your room is a real plus for us.  Our room was missing an ice bucket and come cups, but when texted the help number, we were brought the supplies we needed right away.  They had a large TV and it had Chromcast, so we were able to stream movies from services we already had, Netflix and Hulu.The location is wonderful and we were able to walk to the Art Institute, Millennium park, many restaurants and the River Walk was right in front of the hotel.There is a roof top bar that is very popular and they view is nice, but bar is fairly small so very hard to get into.  They do give hotel guest priority, so that was nice.We ate at the restaurant, Land and Lakes two times.  Once for drinks and dinner and then again for breakfast.  Both meals were good but not anything to get too excited about.  On the weekend they always had a wait list, but Sunday evening and Monday day and evening there was not any wait.We would stay here again if in Chicago to do the normal tourist type things.

Paloma Pina's help was beyond expectations. Let me elaborate: We had a bitter experience with my travel agency (Despegar/Expedia) that decided - unilaterally - to cancel our reservation of our 4 rooms, we were greatly disappointed because we got a really great deal and when we tried to rebook the rooms they wouldn't respect the rate we've got at the beginning, imagine our frustration. Nevertheless, when I reached directly to the hotel, Paloma did some magic and got us even a slightly better rate! This meant the world to us! We can't thank you enough, Paloma. Then when we arrived, even though we arrived around 2am, the check-in was so smooth and fast that we could just run to our beds and get a well deserved rest after a long journey. They even got us the last floor rooms so the view was breathtaking, the icing of the cake. The room and hotel are in mint condition, with everything we needed and the size of the room we thought is more than OK. All our stay was perfect, no problem at all through all our stay, a 10 out of 10 experience. Thank you LondonHouse and even more to you Paloma!",,5.0,5.0,,5.0,,May 2021,,13,2.0

We have reached a point in our lives where paying for a nicer hotel is something we can accommodate, but we were not expecting THIS for what we paid. We had an extremely late arrival time and didn't arrive at the hotel until around 12:30am. Even though we were on West Coast time, we weren't expecting such a delightful check-in experience. We were greeted by a gentleman named Bass (who had the nicest nail beds I have ever seen) who kicked off our stay in the most delightful way. He actually energized me with his delightful energy. Which is a lot to say for an early morning check-in. Bass said we were upgraded to the 1 King Bed Corner Studio and boy do I recommend the upgrade. Even though the room wasn't advertised as a river view (Vista), our room could see the river as well as the lake. It was spacious, came with two robes, and even the bathroom had a view! My only complaint was how many times I took a wrong turn on the way to the room. But that's on me and my horrible sense of direction. We were able to go up to the rooftop on several occasions and were very grateful for the hotel guest priority line. With COVID restrictions, the bar was not packed and it was perfection. The staff was attentive and made great recommendations. The weather was a bit cold for my tastes, but that's cause no one taught me how to layer clothing properly. Thanks mom, dad, and the state of California... The Land & Lake Kitchen was also amazing. Early mornings aren't my friend's thing, so I would go down to order coffee after my workout each morning. They accommodated our unique coffee condiment requests with ease. Each time we ate there, we were delighted. Not a lot of hotels have a restaurant that makes eggs benedict three different ways... We didn't get the chance to eat there for any other meal, but breakfast quickly became my favorite anyway. The Valet team went above and beyond to make us feel welcomed! Each time we walked in or out of the hotel, they made sure to ask us whether there was anything they could do to make our stay better or a simple ""Good Afternoon"". It truly made us feel appreciated and seen as valued guests. Check-out was a breeze on our final day. Not to be outdone by Bass, the gentleman who bid us farewell was also wonderful. (I didn't get his name because I was a little intoxicated after returning from a baseball game...) But whoever he was, THANK YOU!! Five stars to the LondonHouse Chicago. Y'all made this California girl feel oh so special for her 30th birthday and I cannot wait to make my return to the Windy City just to stay here again.",,,5.0,5.0,,5.0,May 2021,,19,32.0

The entry way is a little strange because you constantly run into people also trying to go to the rooftop bar. Only one entryway seems to be open to the hotel. The room was really nice, clean and modern. The sheets were immaculately clean and the shower was perfectly scrubbed before our arrival. Only complaint is there is no fan in the bathroom.We had an issue trying to connect our phones to the Chromecast in the TV, but room service sent a tech that solved our problem and that was appreciated. The location is good for being near many of the bars and restaurants in Chicago and not too far from the subway, although not quite there either. It would be nice if they would guarantee guests a trip to the rooftop, but they don't seem to. I saw a woman span on the host upstairs because she couldn't get in and she had paid for a stay at the hotel. It seems like a given to be honest. We paid for Sunday brunch and then were able to check out the rooftop deck for a peek, but it wasn't open...not really sure why.Overall this hotel is pretty nice.

I am a traveler and frequent different hotels on every staycation and travel. I must say this staff has urgency, hospitality, customer service served with a smile, & pride in what they do. This day in age it’s hard to find staff with one or any of these qualities. For everyone to be on the same page with one another shows how their training and management cares foe them.

The rooms, the views, the rooftop, room service, the front desk.  All 10's.  As for COVID, while it was obvious they were taking appropriate precautions, we never felt impeded.  Just common sense. The elevator calling system, while it took a trip or two to figure out, is what every hotel needs.  No jumping in the first door that opens and crowding in with 20 other riders.

He also made sure that our zoom could be streamed using his personal hotspot.

He is so much fun and such a great help! He knew exactly what we needed when we needed it and was always present. Our photographer loved him too. It is clear that he loves his job and has a wonderful time with each and every guest. Our entire experience was gorgeous and memorable because he made it seamless and enjoyable. Thank you, Manny!!

We booked the room but we were still shopping around. We decided to stay after we had a multitude of friends, from Chicago and everywhere else, telling us we had to checkout the rooftop bar at LondonHouse. Let me tell you how little we regretted that decision   The room: gorgeous lighting, amazing view of the river, perfect size. TVs were easy to work, tons of mirrors that made getting ready easy, EXTREMELY CLEAN. Convenient switches by the bed that turn all the lights off and the blackout curtains block all the light out (no little sliver of curtains that let all the city lights in) very quiet, no sounds of the city nor sounds of slamming doors keeping us up The bed: this gets its own category. WOW. I am a bed snob. I will die on this hill. This was hands down the best bed I’ve stayed in for a hotel. I’m actually disappointed I have to sleep in my own bed tonight. From the linens to the pillows it was a dream. The personnel: friendly, helpful, and out of the way. They were there when you needed them at the drop of a hat. Excellently run hotel. The scene: there was a reason everyone told us to check out the rooftop it goes without saying the experience was spectacular. Our favorite spot, however, was the restaurant downstairs on the first floor. The best breakfast, coffee and morning cocktails. It was fast and delicious. We didn’t go anywhere else for breakfast during our trip because it was so fast, convenient, and did I mention delicious????If you can get a room here it’s worth it. The location is great, getting picked up by an Uber was as simple as it gets in the city, and if you’re struggling the doormen will help you flag them down.

It was my first time in Chicago, and the hotel's location was perfect, right in the middle of everything!  The hotel itself is beautiful with modern interiors and some of the best views of the river. Little did I know, my fiancé had chosen the LondonHouse cupola to propose before I chose the hotel, and the proposal was better than I could've ever imagined!  It seems like there's always something going on at the LondonHouse rooftop, but the cupola has a very private feel with a breathtaking view of Chicago.  The staff at the LondonHouse were all so welcoming and Manny, the event coordinator for the proposal, was first-rate.  Manny was in communication all week with my fiancé and really goes above and beyond.

Last year, I almost had to starve at this hotel since the F&B staff kept contradicting themselves (allegedly due to a wedding) and in the end, even when I held a confirmed reservation at the hotel, I was not allowed to eat at the rooftop restaurant. I made the mistake of giving the hotel a second chance and today, a similar incident occurred: I phoned the hotel's operator and was explicitly told that I could go eat at the rooftop bar but when I went up to the 21st floor, the rude hostess told me that whislt she had space, I would have to go back to the 1st floor to make a reservation. Upon arriving at the reservations booth on the first level, the super rude hostess told me that I would have to wait and she refused, despite me asking several times, to actually give me an estimate of what the wait would be. Do yourself a favor and avoid this hotel. Customer service is non-existent here and there are much better hotels around the Riverwalk for the same pricing points. Note that this hotel is fully aware of its severe customer service issues and they will basically beg you to remove a negative comment, but I'm not falling for their trick again.",,,1.0,3.0,3.0,,October 2020,Traveled on business,159,182.0

Thankfully, there is a room upgrade with awesome view and bigger room already available-(could be free if you have a HILTON gold status.)  I was surprised that my hubby didn't mind paying an upgrade fee since he is very frugal.  Luckily, he made the best decision since we were able to relax right away and start our adventure to the Riverwalk and Magnificent mile.  Did I mention the amazing view from our window?Room was super clean, bed was so comfy, bathroom was large and bright, and decor was modern.  We had difficulty using the remote control but I uploaded the stayconnect app as an alternate.  They have a smart elevator button too.  You just type in the floor you want --and boom-it tells you which one is coming--super fast too.   There are some restaurants connected to the hotel which were good for breakfast, lunch or fine dining.  We especially loved  the LH rooftop-with a romantic atmosphere, amazing views and unique choices of drinks and dishes.  All the staff we met were just outstanding and friendly.  We also felt safe inside and outside the hotel although I still advise anyone to be aware of your surroundings since there will always be homeless people or others asking you random questions.

Housekeeping was by request only, and when requested, did a great job. Our room was on the 20th floor, and provided such a fantastic view of the Riverwalk (esp. the Wrigley Building) that we didn't feel a trip to the rooftop was necessary. The shower was immaculate, and the rest of the room was cozy, with handsome wood finishes. People planning to stay in the room more during the day might want to upgrade for more space, but we found the standard room suited us well. The building is a landmark pointed out by every tour we passed on Wacker Drive, and it is impressive from all angles.

I can honestly say the staff was one of the reasons I continued to extend my stay. Everyone was so nice and welcoming. The room and view was exceptional. As I worked everyday at the perfectly located desk, I would look out at the Chicago River and I just felt so inspired. I loved how each room was sealed with a sticker so you knew your room was cleaned when I checked in. The extra measures the hotel took to ensure safety during Covid was greatly appreciated including the signs that indicating how many people are allowed in a elevator, the food delivery safety measures, and masks requirements when leaving your room. The location was perfect and I could walk everywhere and I did. The rooftop restaurant was absolutely beautiful and I had no problem getting a table even when it was super busy. For those times when I had nonstop meetings, the ability to quickly run up there and place an order to bring back to my room made life so easy for me.

You can easily walk to the Magnificent Mile, River walk, and the subway/train station is a couple block away. It has nice modern rooms in a classic heritage building exterior. Definitely worth checking out for solo, friends, and couples travelers.The rooms vary in size depending on the room type. But all the furnishing and decor are stylish and modern. They certainly have nice rooms with delightfully nice bathrooms. The vista rooms on the newer part of the hotel is clearly nicer than the rest. They are slightly larger with a much larger floor to ceiling windows looking over the River.The hotel has an extremely popular rooftop bar with a long line of people waiting for a table day and night. I didn’t get to check it out as I had a full agenda in my 5 days visit, but a hotel staff kindly took me up for a brief tour on closing hour. It is definitely worth checking out on nice weather.The hotel is definitely ideal for couples without kids or simply friends exploring Chicago city life. They have no swimming pool and their lobby is not very large. But they surely look nice, stylish, clean, and very well maintained. Throughout my stay, this hotel had an incredible police presence guarding the city and the hotel. The police were nice and polite. Never once I felt unsafe around the hotel vicinity.Most importantly, the staff in Londonhouse hotel were extraordinary. They were very nice and accommodating which made our stay even better.

There was no upgrade offered to us unfortunately, but more importantly there is no free breakfast. You are being given $12 vouchers instead to use at the hotel restaurant where most dishes cost around $15. You can probably get pancakes with this voucher, but still have to pay for your coffee (because they removed coffee machine from the rooms) - and speaking of the drinks, there is no espresso/latte or fresh squeezed juice available either, only black coffee or juice from concentrate, that is concerning for a luxury hotel.

Firstly, this location is the best and for the rate at which it comes, it was a bargain!

Just knowing that I could talk to him and reach a workable compromise was so relieving. Also, everything was planned to the minute so I and the guest knew exactly what was supposed to happen and at what time. The complimentary Champagne is one of the best I have tasted and I just had to take the rest with me. I do wish the parking was validated entirely but I am not really complaining about that.

The location of London House is perfect, just steps to shops and restaurants on the Mag Mile, River North and Loop; Blue line to O’Hare, Orange line to Midway and Red line to Wrigley Field. The room was pretty spacious, clean and comfortable too. I loved the huge windows that allowed the lightening outside to light up my room with each stroke during a passing storm.  The barn door separating the room from the restroom was cool too.  I especially loved that the bathroom featured a shower stall versus shower tub combo.  The king bed was as comfy as I expected a Hilton bed to be and I happy that the TV wasn’t small.  Included with my stay was a $12 breakfast voucher to Land and Lake Kitchen on the first floor.

The rates lowered with the pandemic due to low demand, so I changed my booking for this week to this hotel and I was not disappointed at all.I booked a standard king room and figured I would be able to get some sort of upgrade since I'm a Gold member. I started staying at Hilton properties at the beginning of the year and did a status match from a competitor. When I arrived, I asked the front desk staff, Saif, about a complimentary upgrade. He suggested a Vista Room with a good view, but I actually prefer extra space to work with, so I asked if there was a 1 bedroom suite, and there was. I was informed that there would not be much of a view, but I was fine with that. I got my keys and was informed that the restaurant and room service were closed down due to the pandemic, which is completely understandable. Also, I was informed that housekeeping will not be servicing any room until after checkout (probably due to lower staffing needs from low occupancy as well as health reasons), which is not a problem to me since I can easily get any extra amenities by asking the front desk.When I entered my room on the 19th floor, I was pleasantly surprised by how luxurious the furniture looked and how spacious the bathroom was for not having a tub in it (which is fine because I prefer a walk-in shower anyway). I think this hotel is just as luxurious feeling as Waldorf Astoria in Gold Coast, but is much more affordable. The bathroom hygiene products were absolutely fabulous-smelling. I think the bed was the most comfortable bed I've slept on while staying at a hotel in quite some time, since I felt rested and recharged each morning. The elevator was right next to the bathroom wall, but it wasn't overly loud or annoying to me and seemed more like background sound than anything. I could not hear the elevator in the bedroom the entire time I was sleeping, so being next to the elevator was not even a big deal.My fiance was coming later in the evening after I arrived to stay over with me and I told them that they were going to love the room, which they did. We both like this hotel so much that we will be staying here more often. Matthew checked on us the morning we were going to check-out and I told him that everything was wonderful with our stay and that we really appreciate how we got a wonderful upgrade.I did experience an issue with my room keys not working about 3 hours after checking in, which I've noticed seems to happen at other Hilton properties anytime I get a complimentary upgraded room (perhaps others have this happen to them and this can be looked into). I had my digital key, so I just went down to the front desk to get them reprogrammed not much longer after. I also could not get the Chromecast to work on either TV, so I requested assistance with it when I got my keys reprogrammed. The engineer showed up a few minutes after I returned to my room and was able to get one of them working again after a reboot, but not the one in the bedroom. I was grateful that the engineer tried to fix both and left it at that, since I normally stream on my tablet and am used to doing that anyway.I definitely put this hotel at the top of my list for Chicago for service and comfort. I will be returning to stay again for sure.",,,5.0,5.0,,5.0,March 2020,,145,43.0

Booking from home in the UK, I knew I wanted something luxurious to finish our trip of the Midwest and it’s important also for me to be right in the thick of it for easy walking to the local attractions. I guess when I first came across this place I didn’t expect a lot for the price of the rooms but then the reviews were very favourable and location checked out so I figured I’d go for it. It completely exceeded my expectations. The hotel is bang in the centre of Downtown, just off the famous ‘Magnificent Mile’. It’s also directly opposite the towering behemoth that is Trump International and its much classier neighbour, The Langham. Both are five star hotels and rank highly as options for a luxury stay, but both also have prices double the price of the LondonHouse just the other side of the river and which is actually a little closer to top attractions like The Art Institute (a must-see) and also CloudGate / Millennium Park. Speaking frankly, I can’t see that you’d be getting a better deal there versus here. Our room was an absolute steal. On checking in we were assigned one of the vista rooms on the 17th floor (1721 to be precise). Luxuriously appointed, with a fantastic bed and commanding stunning nighttime views down the river, it’s everything you could ever want. The Malin+Goetz toiletries are the icing on the cake. Whilst staying I also checked out the gym for a short workout and found it more than adequate. Whilst it is, indeed, windowless and not large, it’s tastefully decorated with a good range of aerobic, resistance machine and free weights. It’s more a fitness suite than gym but it’s more than sufficient for the size of hotel and room rate in my eyes. I didn’t check out the rooftop bar, which I know is one of the hotel’s pulls, mostly as we were out late the nights we stayed and both agreed the view wouldn’t be hugely different than that from our room just a couple of floors below. All in all, we were delighted with our stay and I’d not only recommend to friends and family but return myself without a second’s hesitation.",,,,,,,January 2020,Traveled as a couple,412,230.0

Decided on LondonHouse after much research as seemed to offer good value for money plus an excellent location.On arrival in the evening, we proceeded to check-in which is on level 2 as others have mentioned, easily accessed in the lift. Check-in was quick, simple and efficient, but lacked any personality really or warmth. We paid the extra in advance for a river view which would highly recommended, great being able to look out over the city and watch the world go by. Room was spacious right in the corner, very clean and a SUPER comfy bed. Shower and bathroom very nice as well. Just a few things could have been improved here,- No tea facilities. They provided a fancy coffee machine, but if you want a tea its room service only, which is a shocker given even the cheapest 1star hotels probably provide a kettle.- You cant adjust the pressure of the shower as this is hand in hand with the temperatureFor exploring, the hotel couldn't be better. Location was excellent and seemed to be able to reach all the attractions of the city very easily. It was also a good reference point being right in the middle of the city.A great base to stay really, it's just that I feel personality and service was lacking. This might be because of the lobby being on level 2, and so you only interact with any staff during check-in and check-out as most other times its room level to ground. This just created a gap in terms of service I felt, as the only people you saw daily were the bell boys on your way out the door.Would highly recommend and stay again, just not quite the 5star service I've experienced elsewhere.Note- My original review was for 4 stars, however since posting I was contacted by the Director of the Front Office which was quite surprising. She seemed genuinely interested into my points raised on my review above and said how these will be looked to be improved. It made a refreshing change for a hotel to reach out directly and even offered a partial refund due to the points made which was quite unbelievable as we did have a great overall stay. I therefore felt the need to highlight this great service recovery and amend my post to a 5 star as I really was impress with the after service here, and as already stated, would highly recommend the hotel.",,5.0,4.0,,,5.0,December 2019,,24,29.0

One small issue was the noise. I specifically requested a room with a bathtub to take a bath, and that room happened to be on a lower floor (the 6th floor), which meant you did get a bit of traffic noise. They were very kind in accommodating me with a room that had a bathtub. On the other hand, the beds and the pillows were extremely comfortable, which made for a good night's sleep.There was also a Nespresso machine in the room, which is always a nice plus.The location is very walkable. You are 5 blocks to the Bean and the park, as well as a short walk to the main shopping areas and the pier. There is also a Corner Bakery downstairs, which is convenient for coffee and breakfast.I did not get up to the roof as it was very cold when I stayed at the hotel, though it is supposed to be worth checking out.

Great Location. Great Hotel!,"Stayed at London House in December 2019. From check-in, staff was very helpful and friendly. Have stayed at other hotels in Chicago and LH so far has been the most enjoyable. Ended up with a great room viewing over the river and Michigan Avenue. Throughout the stay LH communicated via text, checking in making sure everything was ok. Ken, Shannon, Keith, Viktor and Jalesa were all great and super nice.I normally do not write reviews, but was very happy to see that LH has great customer service. This is what made the stay the best. As to the hotel, the room was city sized, but very clean and very nice. Has a refrigirator, great TV, which yes, allowed to use streaming apps via chromecast. This was a nice plus that I don't see everywhere yet. The rooftop bar is probably the best in Chicago, it is such a beatiful view. We had great weather, so had a chance to enjoy a drink on the rooftop in December. Even though there is no service on the rooftop in winter, the Bar on 21 is great. You can grab a drink there (LH Old Fashioned's are the best!) and then pop up on the rooftop to get some pictures and great views. I had been to the rooftop in summertime as well, which of course is even better! The Bridges lobby bar is also really nice and comfortable. Lastly we ate at the restaurant Ocean Prime, which is in the hotel. This place is a whole other review in itself. Dinner was fantastic! I really enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay again.

Each stay has been good, and all have been on business. It was a few days of business meetings, which brought us back to LondonHouse in February. We had done a business dinner at the airport Hilton, and then moved to LondonHouse, the next morning. As my wife had meetings starting early, I checked us in, but due to the early hour, our room was not ready, and I had not expected it to be. I had our luggage stored, and retired to the lobby bar, until we had a room.Being HHonors Diamond members, we got an upgrade, and I was assigned Room 1909. This was our second stay in that room, and we find it to be very nice. It is in the newer section of the LondonHouse, which spans over two buildings: one, the historic building, closer to the Lake, and then the newer building, up the River. Personally, I really liked our corner suite in the historic section, with views of both the River, and the Lake (or a small portion of the Lake), but the rooms in the newer section are nice, as well.The room features a comfortable King bed, a small sitting area, an ample bathroom, and a closet large enough for all of our business clothing. This room features plenty of drawers for clothing storage, as well. The closet has an iron, ironing board, and safe, and it is of a horizontal design, so that one does not have to worry about their tablets, etc falling out, when opened. I really prefer these to the vertical wall-mount safes, and am always glad to see them.Room 1909's bathroom, while small, and with a single sink, with an adequately large vanity area, and a nice walk-in shower was satisfactory for us. This is a benefit to my wife, who has two artificial hips. The tub/shower combos are just not as comfortable, or convenient for her. I feel that the LondonHouse has the shower specifications in our dossier, and that is why we have now been in this particular room twice - if so, very, very nice touch.This room has a double thermostat setup, and both worked well, allowing us to keep the temperature of the bedroom a bit cooler. When I entered, the room heat was on, but was easily adjusted down, where it stayed - nice and cool, though it was cold outside. I liked that we also had remote controls for the shades in the bedroom, and with the blackout shade employed, the room was adequately dark. As there is a giant, bright sign on the Trump Tower, just across the River, and immediately in front of Room 1909, the ability to shut out all light is a very positive aspect.We had a desk, a large flat-screen TV, and a small sitting area in the bedroom, and then, there was another TV and small sofa, between the bedroom and the bathroom. That small sitting area, while not all that useful, is nice, just for the room that it affords. There is a frosted glass panel, between it, and the bedroom, so it’s not quite like having a separate room to watch TV, if one is sleeping in the bedroom. However, it does offer a sound buffer, if one is in the shower, while the other is still sleeping.Room 1909 has ample AC and USB ports, plus good horizontal surfaces for charging devices. With all of our various devices, this is a big positive, and it seems that the interior designers had the business traveler in mind, when they did LondonHouse.Our room, though facing the River, and East Upper Wacker Drive, was very quiet, and we also heard no noise from within the hotel. Actually, with the exception of the bar area, off of the lobby, the entire hotel is quiet, and even then, the bar, Bridges, is not that noisy, even in the evening, when it seems to fill up.While we had few interactions with the staff (beyond the bar), all were very pleasant and every request we had was quickly accommodated, with a friendly smile. Room 1909 felt like “home away from home,” and it was nice to be in a room, where we knew where things were. Stumbling around in the dark, in an unfamiliar hotel, is just never fun.We enjoy the location too, being just inside the Loop, but close to so very much. We find the LondonHouse to be very convenient.This was another excellent stay at the LondonHouse, and as my wife’s corporate office has moved to Chicago, we will be returning.",5.0,,5.0,,,5.0,February 2019,Traveled on business,166281,2721.0

Grace at the front desk was very friendly, welcomed us as Diamond members and answered a few questions patiently. The room itself is decent sized, bed was very comfortable, 55” TV with a lot of channels, and a great walk in shower. For breakfast we received two $12 vouchers.

It wants to be a high end Hilton property, but it doesn’t have the high end customer service to make it such. The elevator system is modern, but a poor design, which leaves you waiting for minutes for an elevator to show up when there are 6 elevators for 21 floors. The suites aren’t much up an upgrade over a regular room. All the rooms and suites are shotgun style with a sitting area and TV added to the suites with floor to ceiling windows. The location is excellent and walking distance to most major shopping and attractions downtown. The parking is $73 a night, which seems high even for downtown Chicago, most are around $50. The front desk staff is average at best, switched rooms halfway through our stay and was told our room would be ready soon and they would text us as it was being inspected, two hours later we stopped back at the front desk and were given the same story. After saying we have heard this story, they finally came through with the room 15 minutes later. They room was move was not our choice and we were forced to pay to store our luggage for the day and then move back into the new room, along with the time spent moving between rooms.

I was greeted with respect and she apologized sincerely for the way that I was treated by the staff. She politely asked what can she do to make things better which caught me off guard. The reason is that I haven't had this type of experience from any Hilton hotel and I never expected anyone to care about what happened to me but she did and that goes a long way. I would like to thank her for being so kind and caring enough to attempt to correct the issue. I will give this hotel another chance to show what the Hilton brand is truly about. Outside of the experience that I had with the staff I can honestly say that this hotel is absolutely beautiful. The moment I walked in the room I saw that it is extremely spacious with ample storage space, a nespresso machine, great views of the river, a huge television with Chromecast capabilities, beautiful bathroom with motion lighting and large stand in shower. The floor (13th) that I was on was very quiet and there is a keypad outside of the elevators that you will have to choose your floor before getting on. I am hoping with the next visit I will be able to experience the beautiful Rooftop. I did not park at the hotel because it is Valet only and $71 per night.

You could walk to several CTA stations in the Loop or the Millenium Park Metra station for ease of transport options.Curiously the reception is not on the ground floor; there are two entrances from Wacker Drive, and you have to go up one floor to get reception.One unusual feature was that you had to request the floor you wanted to travel BEFORE the lift arrived, and you could only get into a specific lift.  This means you can't just rush into any lift with the door open, as it won't have ""programmed"" your floor.The room: spacious with a window ""seat"" (even if we had to look at the Trump sign) with river views.  There was a small study desk, generous wardrobe with hangers, robes and an in-room safe and fridge; coffee and tea making looked quite posh.  There was a comfy chair beside the bed, perfect for curling up and relaxing. Bonus full length mirror!The bathroom: generous sized shower and sink with plenty of storage options and drawers.  Fluffy towels, great hot water, beautiful amenities.One downside: we were near the hotel lifts.  The lift shafts make a lot of whirring noises, with the cables going up and down, all day and night.We seriously enjoyed a fabulous stay in this beautiful historic building in an unbeatable location, and would definitely stay here again.",5.0,,5.0,,,5.0,October 2019,,824,132.0

The hotel is close to Millennium Park, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Chicago Cultural Center, Michigan Ave., energetic Wacker Drive, and even the Loop business district if your trip is for work. Many rooms also have amazing views up and down the Chicago River. The only downside - depending on your point of view (literally) - is that some rooms look across the river at Trump Tower and its hideous TRUMP sign. The hotel is in a historic building surrounded by similar buildings from Chicago's past with interesting architectural details visible form the higher floors. The hotel has a trademark cupola at the top of the building, which you can enter by way of the rooftop bar/restaurant. It's a great place for a drink with a stunning view when weather permits.We usually choose a suite, which is spacious and comfortable; I love the amenities, like the in-room refrigerator and Nespresso machine. The rooms are clean, well-kept, and quiet, with luxurious bedding and large bathrooms - although I'm not a fan of the sliding, frosted-glass bathroom door, which doesn't quite give complete privacy.Then there's the service, which really distinguishes this hotel. On our first visit, the staff helped me plan a surprise for my wife's birthday: Champagne in the cupola, along with flowers waiting in our room. On each visit, the staff have been extremely attentive; I love that I could make requests via text message, and there was always someone monitoring the number and following up after each service. They genuinely wanted to make sure every request was taken care of and that we had everything we needed. It's the service most of all that keeps us going back.I do have to quibble about a few things, though: The hotel restaurant on 21 is a dark, mostly windowless space, and when we went for Sunday brunch, we turned around and left, because they were incongruously playing loud, not-very-soothing music, which seemed like an odd choice for such an otherwise relaxing hotel. Speaking of music, I didn't like the fact that the music channels on the in-room TV are a $10/day charge. I would love to relax in our suite with classical music playing, but not for a fee. Seems excessive to nickel-and-dime guests that way.On the whole, though, you can't beat the space, the location, and especially the service.",,,5.0,4.0,5.0,,November 2019,,167,160.0

I started at 2:15 pm on a Saturday with checkin time being 4PM. I simply wanted to store my bags so I can watch the LSU game until checkin. Grace immediately told me there were 2 rooms available if I wanted to check in, saw my Hilton Gold status and upgraded me to an absolutely amazing room with a stunning view of the River. The Lobby bar was upscale and hip compared to the corporate feeling at the Hilton and then the Rooftop bar was breathtaking. Service was attentive and I felt like a VIP.  I booked for two days then and extended my stay another two days with Bess at the front desk. He was truly the highlight of my trip. He upgraded me as well but also offered me a complimentary breakfast at the downstairs restaurant, Land & Lake. He remained my contact for the rest of my stay and when I had a problem with the slow internet he immediately remedied it.

You could not pick a better place to stay while visiting Chicago.   The LondonHouse was fantastic from the moment we arrived until the day we left.Our room was on the 16th floor and had a fantastic river view!  The room was kept immaculate by the housekeeping staff during our entire stay.   The in-room Nespresso coffee maker was a big plus in as we have one at home and loved being able to have espresso early in the morning.The fitness center was well equipped for a boutique hotel gym.   There were multiple treadmills, a Concept 2 Rower, several ellipticals, dumbbells up to 50lbs and a Hoist cable machine.  A huge perk for us was the two Peloton Bikes that were in the fitness center.   As my wife and I are avid home riders of Peloton,  having a bike we could use while visiting Chicago was a big plus.   The only downside was the bikes could use some serious maintenance.  One bike had several adjustment  handles broken off and the rubberized floor in the fitness center made the bikes less stable than had they been on a solid floor.   No indoor pool though so if you are traveling with kids who love to use the hotel pool, this might not be the hotel for you.If traveling to Chicago again in the future I would definitely consider staying at the LondonHouse hotel again.Pro Tips:>>Rooftop bar (outside) is insanely crowded so get there early if you want to enjoy your time and the view>>Hotel gym has two Peloton Bikes with SPD/Toe Cage Pedals (LOOK cleats will not work)>>Lobby Bar has fantastic cocktails including a great Empress 1908 Gin & Tonic>>Top floor rooms may not be the ideal choice if you are a light sleeper due to noise from the rooftop bar.

The ambiance is incredible it’s very loungy but and the same time incredibly cozy but the thing that made my trip were the night hosts Bess and April. They were incredibly empathetic to my situation of the cancelled flight offering suggestions on amazing places to eat and sights to see while in town. As my flight was cancelled and it was a 24 hour lay over they also pushed my check out to 1:00pm to allow me some extra time to catch up on work. - To the management get these two off the night shift and on during the day! They are an asset you your team and have turned what should have been an irritating lay over into a much needed mini vacation. The next time I’m in Chicago I will only stay here because of them.,,,,,,,October 2019,Traveled with friends,1,

The attention to detail that the staff maintain is fantastic. While our most recent stay was definitely atypical in the level of service we received, management was quick to follow up and addressed the issues at hand. Our most recent visit (September 2019) was still great, but the front desk agent did not stand up to the level of professionalism we were used to at this property, there was no ""check in to see how your stay is"" text, and there were some minor issues with pillows being subpar/minor room details. Paloma was fast at following up and happily addressed all of our concerns in a timely and professional manner. She turned our experience around and I would not hesitate to stay at LondonHouse again. Being a Hilton Honors Member I like to feel like I'm being cared for. Paloma and her team made sure of that and I feel reassured that Hilton truly cares about their customers (Honors Member or not). If you're staying at LondonHouse I highly recommend checking out their rooftop bar and the floor below it. While the rooftop was crowded during out latest visit (there was an event), the views are incredible and it's easily accessible. The floor below the rooftop was great despite them being out of the honeycomb, which we really looked forward to trying. The truffle fries were absolutely delicious, as were our drinks. All in all, if LondonHouse keeps up with the attention to detail and care for their customers I see no issues with returning time and time again.

They hold parties in the function rooms and on Saturday night it was extremely loud until around 11:30pm. There were also people walking through the foyers all night and my room was right near some lifts. If you have kids or need a good sleep I’d recommend an upper level room or a room that is not near the lifts. Great location. CBD, North and West easy accessible by foot.

It is within walking distance of nearly everything you would want to see. The rooms are very clean and tastefully decorated. The room size is comparable with most other luxury hotels in the city with a beautiful walk-in shower. The rooms have a refrigerator and espresso machine but there are three coffee/breakfast/bakery places right outside the hotel. The river and city views are beautiful. There is a rooftop indoor/outdoor bar and restaurant. We had a lovely brunch there. It is a very popular local night spot as well, but if you are a guest at the hotel,  you do not have to wait in line to access the rooftop. There are spa services available with flexible hours and several other restaurants on site. The concierge was very helpful and friendly. The hotel will keep your luggage after checkout if you are leaving the city later in the day. Housekeeping comes daily to clean room, replace towels and make bed. You can opt out of this at your choosing. We have stayed at other hotels of the same caliber in Chicago. Even though we had a hiccup with our stay, because the Hotel went out of their way to make it right, I would definitely stay here again.

Hotel is very well located, facilities are cool, and room was well appointed, but not well kept. Door handle on bathroom door about to fall off and toilet seat was loose. I informed the hotel about this early morning after the first night, however nothing happened. Only after addressing the issue once more in person they seamed to care about it and have it fixed. As a gold member I was told in the booking confirmation to inform to the attendant when having breakfast to get the ""Continental Breakfast"". However, that was not true. I was told that I should have been given vouchers at check in. I am annoyed that the receptionist pay no attention to such details when checking in guests. Why have a loyalty program if the employees do not care about it! After getting the vouchers I noted that they were just for a few dollars, and would not even cover a ""Continental Breakfast"" from the a la carte menu. So in fact the ""free continental breakfast"" for gold members is not true, or lets say ""not accurate"" to be kind.I did address the lack of follow up on the maintenance issue to an agent via the Hilton app. They offered me 50USD or 5000 points compensation, which I accepted all tough I will probably get any benefit out of those as I think I´ll pass on Hilton hotels in the future.

So there is not one in the hole hotel. But there is a refrigerator so you can keep your drinks cold. The elevators threw me off a bite. We are use to getting in and selecting your floor. At each elevator where we normally push up or down is a pad. You select your floor number and it tells you what elevator to take. Several times I forgot to look and see what elevator it was.

We would come back every day to loud music and people waiting to go up. They do try to keep people out of the way but as larger groups stand in line the wider the line got. Also the louder the music the louder the people. Luckily we were several floors away so we didn't hear it from our room. The concierge was very helpful. The restaurants she suggested where great.

Honestly i think it has the best view of the city. Our guests had priority access to the elevator and didn't have to stand in the long line for the elevators for the general public. Our deck had lots of comfy outdoor couch seating for 40-50 people, as well as a big private indoor room with big windows. The room also had AV equipment so would be perfect for a corporate meeting or private parties such as a small wedding reception. The banquet menu was over 40 pages long with a ton of different food options, not only all the typical food you'd expect from a conference facility but also unique ideas such as a poke bar, hot rock station, and ceviche or sushi. The food was excellent and they were very accommodating of special requests (food allergies and other modifications to the menu). The best part was not only were the facilities world-class, but the conference staff were amazing as well. The staff were incredibly responsive to all of my questions during the planning process leading up to the event, and extremely detail oriented and flexible. They were all very professional and treated us like VIPs. I can't wait to hold another event at Londonhouse so that I can work with them again, (and also get on that private deck again!).",,,,,,,August 2019,,12,14.0

Room was very clean and comfortable. Had a 9th floor view of the Chicago River, directly across from Trump Tower. Not much street noise overall at that height. And speaking of height, there’s a rooftop restaurant and open air bar at the top of the building that offers breathtaking views of the surrounding area any time of day. Room service was prompt and very tasty. Large flat screen TV on the wall made me feel right at home. My only real complaint was that when I first arrived at the hotel and walked in at street level, I couldn’t figure out where the lobby and reception desk were. There was no signage. After asking a random bellhop(?) I was told I had to go upstairs to the second floor. Not the most welcoming experience. Otherwise it was great.

I also noticed that when housekeeping came in to clean the room and makeup the beds, the sheets were never folded in the corners and rather the sheets were left hanging off of the side of the bed every night.

We stayed for a Saturday couples trip in June with Hilton honors points. As we waited for our room, we went to the rooftop bar & had drinks and an appetizer. Being hotel guests gets you to the front of a very long line, as it is quite popular in the good weather along the Chicago River. The service, drinks, and food were good. Our room was very nice with a spectacular river view and it was all modern. This is a great location for walking and accessing Michigan Avenue, Millennial Park, and the riverfront. The downsides to this hotel are the elevator crowds & difficult to manage key system, which requires before access swiping, which has restrictions on what arriving elevator you can take- causing crowds & waits to get to your room & the lobby. The parking is challenging as there are multiple hotels in a row all trying to valet cars on a very busy street. Overall, very good hotel & plan to return again sometime.

Considered the Conrad and LH in Chicago, and we were so happy we chose the LH! The location is great for all activities and fabulous restaurants. With SpotHero app we chose a slightly less expensive overnight parking right next door Club Quarters through the app. The best feature at the LH is its employees! The busy 4th of July weekend had the hotel bustling with people and activity. There were employees stationed at just the right places to help us navigate. The elevator system is different than anywhere we’ve stayed, but it was no problem because strategically-positioned employees taught us the system. ALL employees were kind and friendly including Land and Lake. That hardly happens anywhere. Loved the extra amenities (like hair band and round cotton face pad) in the room, and the bar soap and lotion scents smelled wonderful. Land and Lake was delicious for breakfasts using diamond member vouchers for most of bill. The staff in the Bridges lounge at night were great. I’m sorry I don’t have the name of the female bartender/server. She was so helpful and friendly! Hope to return here some day. I loved the interior design of the hotel too.

Nepresso machine was nice touch.We checked in online and attempted to use our electronic key which didn’t work and I am so thankful because I got to observe all the drunk loud people on the 20th floor coming to and from the rooftop patio. We requested to be on another floor, front desk agreed that would be better for a family and easily changed, 7th floor no problem. FYI for your floor choice I would avoid 20 unless you are really wanting that kind of thing. I just have to warn you about the crowds at all times of the day and night trying to get to the rooftop patio. They have a line roped off with an staff member getting people on and off elevator but people are impatient therefore hop on guest elevators trying to get up there but doesn’t work really given the elevator system they have. They then take stairs or once you get out on a guest floor you can push any button to get to top floor. I feel it’s a safety concern for guests of  the hotel and just not a well oiled machine yet.

Mr. Anthony. WOW This Concierge is amazing. He was so friendly, service oriented, knowledgeable and fun! He gave us a tour of the property and it's history. We never knew it's connection to Perfect Strangers! He took us through all the levels from the ground up and knew every detail and answered every question. He also arranged for our high tea the next day. As someone who has been in the industry for MANY years and comes from a hospitality family, he blew us away. We also met briefly, Ms. Shannon, their Chef Concierge. What a lovely, professional, friendly person. She was at the Concierge Desk when we arrived for our tea, so we didn't get to spend too much time with her, but the time we did was well spent. She gave us additional information and tips to make our Chicago visit more enjoyable. We didn't get to meet their third Concierge, however if they are anything like these two, then, BRAVO LONDONHOUSE. You have an ace concierge team! A Concierge Dream Team, if you will.Our tea service was wonderful. Cecil was our server. What a kind, professional young man who knows his craft WELL. We were certainly impressed with his such strong knowledge of the tea menu especially since it was fairly new! The tea options were plentiful, and the food was DELICIOUS. It doesn't look like it would fill you up, but trust me, you will be.The LondonHouse Chicago is a beautiful structure full of history and 1920s class and sophistication. The night of our tour with Anthony, the lobby had live music - soft, not too loud that you can't hear or enjoy your conversations - the young woman and her guitarist companion were a nice welcoming treat that added nicely to the ambiance. The grandeur of the former entrance was captivating. The gold, the murals and the history behind it was just great. Again, I can't speak on anything more than this, but based on this alone, I promise you that the LondonHouse Chicago is our #1 location for our next visit.

The view down the river was fantastic. Loved watching the world go by down below.  The room was great, very spacious and very quiet considering how noisy on the street it was when we were down there walking about. We had a few problems with the blind and the safe not working when we arrived but these were quickly fixed after a quick phone call to guest services. The position of this hotel is perfect for walking to all the places we wanted to see for our 5 days in Chicago. The Cloud was a 10 mins walk away and Navy Pier about 25 mins. All staff were very pleasant and helpful, particularly the bar man in the lobby area and our lovely smiley room maid who greeted us by name most mornings! We had a fabulous breakfast in the restaurant on the ground floor every morning which set us up nicely for the day. The staff in there were lovely, too. Our only complaint about this hotel is that we tried on three occasions, at different times to go up to the outdoor rooftop area and were told it was either full or there was a long wait to get a table. It was a very popular venue for people not staying at the hotel to visit. There were long queues waiting to go up in the lift in the ground floor lobby most afternoons/evenings. I would, however, definitely return here on our next visit to Chicago.",,,,,,,June 2019,Traveled with family,15,10.0

The location is great. Walking distance to so many great attractions. We walked to the pier, Michigan Ave shopping, the bean, Millennial Park, theater district, and it’s close to the subway. It’s right across from the river, so many of the boat excursions are out your front door. The staff was friendly, rooftop bar was awesome, the ambiance is lovely. That being said, we were very disappointed in our room. I read the reviews on TripAdvisor prior to booking our stay, and upgraded our family to a “vista room” to have “floor to ceiling” windows with incredible lake views. I am a light sleeper, so I always request rooms away from elevators. When we checked in, the only two rooms they had for us were near an elevator. So, that’s what we got. I tried to make the best of it, but it truly effected our trip. We were also near a stairwell, and all night we could either hear people getting off the elevators or the stairwell door opening and closing. The hotel is convenient but with that, comes a lot of street noise from E Wacker and Michigan Ave. We heard fire truck or police sirens nightly.  Not the best sleep for our 4 night stay. I’m not sure if all the vista rooms face the Trump Tower, but ours did. So our “floor to ceiling” views were more of that, than the river. I stayed at Loews last visit and would definitely choose that hotel over London House.",,,,,,,June 2019,Traveled with family,52,10.0

This was our fourth stay at this hotel, and was again, a very good one.Once more, we had a room in the “new tower,” with views of the Chicago River. Our room, 1909, was quite comfortable. It featured a comfortable King bed, a small sitting area, an ample bathroom, and a closet large enough for all of our business clothing, since we were heading from Chicago to meetings in San Francisco, on this trip. We had plenty of drawers for clothing storage, as well. The closet had an iron, ironing board, and safe, which was a horizontal design, so that tablets, laptops and the like, did not fall out, when one opened it. I really prefer these to the vertical wall-mount safes..The bathroom, while small, had a single sink, with an adequately large vanity area, and a nice walk-in shower. This is a benefit to my wife, who has two artificial hips. The tub/shower combos are just not as comfortable, or convenient for her.We had a double thermostat setup, and both worked well. We also had remote controls for the shades in the bedroom, and with the blackout shade employed, the room was adequately dark.In the bedroom area, we had a desk, a large flat-screen TV, and a small sitting area. Then, there was another TV and small sofa, between the bedroom and the bathroom. While nice, because of the frosted glass partition between this sitting area, and the bedroom, it was not really conducive for one to be watching TV, or reading in there, while the other was trying to sleep. Still, a nice, spacious addition.Our room had ample AC and USB ports, plus good horizontal surfaces for charging devices. Being HHonors Diamond, we got bottled water during the stay.Our room, though facing the River, and East Upper Wacker Drive, was very quiet, and we also heard no noise from within the hotel.The lobby areas were decorated for Christmas, and all common spaces were lovely. There were even carolers in the lobby bar, Bridges, several times.During this stay, I dined on-property at the lobby bar, and downstairs at Land & Lake for breakfast, which was included as part of our HHonors Diamond “package.”Once more, this was a very nice stay, at a lovely, historic and beautifully located property. My wife’s meetings were just across the River, so even in the cool December weather, she could easily walk. We also walked to several near-by restaurants, and I did some shopping, just over the River.The staff was very friendly, and we wanted for nothing.

After much comparison shopping, I settled on a deal on Priceline for the London House. I upgraded from a basic room to a Vista King room, hoping for something pretty special. After an early flight into Midway airport, we took the EL train into the city, and walked the three blocks to the hotel. Arriving at about 10 am, we were met inside by the bellhops, who explained that the lobby was on the second floor, and that they could hold our bags while we did pre-check in, then the bags would be brought to the room when actual check-in happened. We checked our bags, and went up to the lobby, where Matthew checked us in, and said the room was already available. We were so pleased to be able to get to the room early to rest and freshen up, and to enjoy the iconic river view. And what a view it was! Whenever we were in the room, we just wanted to sit and stare out the window at the river, the bridges, the skyline, and the activities below us. And what a comfortable room! My wife described it as “homey chic,” with contemporary colors and lines, but friendly accessories. I made myself a cup of coffee with the Nespresso machine, and we napped on the very comfortable bed. We kept leftovers in the mini-fridge, and valuables in the safe. The luxurious bathroom had motion-sensing lighting, and a unique frosted-glass sliding door. Travel hack: Move the bench from under the sink into the room for an extra suitcase rack. We would have liked stronger shower pressure, a few more places to hang wet towels, and the bathroom had no ceiling fan (almost a must for me), but those minor shortcomings did not cloud our bright experience. Yes, you can hear some street sounds, especially if an emergency vehicle goes by, but they were sufficiently muffled and did not disturb our sleep.The hotel has two parts; the old building, dating back to 1923, and the brand-new glass section attached, which contains the lobby, the restaurant, and the upgraded Vista King rooms, with floor-to ceiling windows. Don’t miss the rooftop bar, spanning the width of both the old and new buildings, with its fantastic views. Take the elevator to the 21st floor, then take another elevator or the stairs up one more floor to the roof. (Drinks are expensive, but you don’t have to buy one to hang out. I splurged on one, and it was really good.) The elevator controls are unique, with a learning curve. Enter your floor number on the screen to call for the elevator; the screen will indicate which elevator to take. There are no buttons inside the elevator; trust it to take you to your floor. After a couple of times we were using it like pros.We had two heroes while visiting the London House. Matthew at the front desk first gave us a great room on the 15th floor (1510). Then, when I asked him about the “free breakfast” that was on my Priceline reservation, he could not find it in the hotel’s system, but he comped us the meal because it was our anniversary. (Scout’s honor it was in Priceline’s deal; I have a copy of the reservation confirmation that shows it.) The “American Classic” breakfast in the onsite “Land and Lakes” restaurant was very good, by the way (see my separate review). Our other hero was Alonzo, one of the bell captains. He was so helpful to us on several occasions, and he recommended a restaurant near Millennium Park called Wildberry Pancakes, which was so good. (See my separate review of that one.)This hotel would be a great “home base” for exploring the city; walking distance to the Loop, State Street, and Millennium Park; a short bus, taxi or Uber ride to Navy Pier, museums, or Water Tower Place. We are pleased to say that this is one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in.

The rooftop patio was amazing and had an AMAZING view of the skyline. Our waitress there was wonderful also!This hotel was a FIVE STAR destination. Everyone at the hotel was pleasurable and professional! The location was amazing and in the middle of Chicago.It is easy to complain about a hotel when service is below par, but for me to review a hotel for exemplary service is a rare thing, but the LondonHouse was deserving!This hotel made for a memorable and fun family trip to Chicago!

The location is excellent, overlooking the river - very near the north side yet still near the lake front and the loop.  The hotel has a very modern decor and is pretty clean.  Service was good.  Our room on the 19th floor was accessible and quite beautiful.  The view of the river is so fascinating and beautiful. The bed was fairly comfortable; very little storage space for clothes in the accessible king room we had.  Roll-in shower. On the down side, the elevator system is not only confusing but also very inefficient.  (I know, how weird can elevators be?  This system is new and just plain weird.)  The rooftop bar is nice in good weather; we visited briefly.  We also tried the restaurant once, which we liked pretty much; see separate review.  Overall, we would probably go back to staying at the Palmer House as we prefer their classic hotel setup, restaurant, and price, tho we prefer the location of the LondonHouse.

It has no room service after 10pm forcing you to go clubbing on the 21st floor with a bunch of drunk 20 somethings to get a burger. Oh, and a tiny Diet Coke was $5. And if that wasn’t enough, I discovered refills aren’t free! Ha ha. Oh, and don’t try to order breakfast in advance with the placard because instead of allowing you to place your order up until 2am like every other business hotel on the Loop, these guys stop working at 11pm. So, no breakfast ordering either. The check in is abysmal. 2 people working who appeared to be part of the young clubby scene and took forever.

Since this was my husband's first trip to Chicago, I opted for an upgrade to a river-view King. It was a spacious room on the 12th floor with beautiful views. Facing the river didn't add much outside noise either. The room was spotless and had everything you needed. At first I thought we were short on drawer space, but I found hidden ones under the bed. Note the bathroom has the funky glass, frosted door that is more form than function. The shower pressure and temperature were consistent all week. The heating and cooling in the room worked great too. The bed was super comfortable and it had great pillows. Check-in was a breeze and we were given two water bottles. Loved the historic nature of the building and the beautiful architecture and decor. The rooftop bar was very pretty, but we didn't spend much time up there as it was still chilly. We didn't eat breakfast at the hotel as there were so many coffee spots near the hotel. Same with dinner. We did eat at Land & Lake which was on the first floor and it was very tasty. It is a quick walk to the Mag Mile or down to Millenium Park. Great having the riverwalk so close too. Enjoyed watching the art projections on Merchandise Mart one evening.

Still those letters were the default view.The biggest asset of this hotel is location.You are where everyone wants to walk and you just step in to your hotel. It is obviously busy as well. That is the downside. N Michigan Avenue is busy round the clock, and seems to be used a lot by first responders. Frequent sirens penetrate the room, which I found disturbing.The hotel has smart elevators, the staff polite.

So when I volunteered to help set up for a benefit we were attending in downtown Chicago one Saturday night, a day which also required me to kill a few hours and change in between setup and event, we decided to make a mini-staycation of it (even though we only live eight miles away and I work down the block) and book a room at the LondonHouse. We chose LondonHouse not only for its proximity to our event, but because, as part of the Curio Collection, it has more character than your average Hilton. We weren't disappointed. The check-in process was smooth (and I noticed the representative next to me handling an entitled tourist who was upset about not being able to check into a room that didn't have her name on it with great skill. Bravo on the patience!). Not only was I offered an upgrade thanks to my Gold status, but I was given the choice of a room with a river and lake view or a suite. I always appreciate being asked when the hotel has flexibility. Were I alone, I probably would have chosen the suite, but the view was a nice touch for our staycation. Speaking of the view -- it was indeed gorgeous, but being on the 13th floor meant that we were basically eye level with the completely obnoxious DRUMPF sign on Drumpf Tower, a sign so comically large and tacky that it caused the City of Chicago to later pass an ordinance restricting such huge building signage so close to the ground (the sign is one of my least favorite things about living in this beautiful city, and pretty much universally hated in this city of great architecture, regardless of your political affiliation). So this has nothing to do with the LondonHouse, just be aware if you have strong feelings on such things. Had I realized this, I probably would have chosen the room with a view I was offered on the 4th floor instead.Back to the room -- the bed was very comfortable, the bathroom had great Malin + Goetz products, and they made great use of a relatively small space. And the woman who granted us a late check-out couldn't have been nicer. We'll definitely return to LondonHouse for our mini-staycations, and I'll recommend it to visiting family and friends.",,5.0,5.0,,5.0,,April 2019,Traveled as a couple,96,94.0

It was our first time in Chicago.We checked in on line the day before - the earliest time to check in was 4pm. We arrived at the hotel at around 2pm, catching the Loop from Midway Airport and just a short walk. We were fine leaving our luggage and going for a short walk although we were very jetlagged. The receptionist said they would send us a message once the room was ready.At 4pm on the dot and having received nothing we went back to the hotel, we were told the room still wasn't ready but we were offered a drink in the bar. Waiting for a room is always annoying especially after long flights and with a five hour time difference, but there was nothing they could do so we chose to wait around at reception and finally at 4:30 we got the keys.Room 1410'was amazing, we had a wonderful view over the river - in fact all along the river! It wasn't a huge room, there wasn't a massive amount of storage space and it is the first time we have had drawers under the bed in a hotel! The safe was low down and drawer style so very comfortable to use. There was a large TV with all the usual channels  and the internet was fast. The room was beautifully decorated with a huge floor to ceiling window framing the glorious view. The bathroom was compact but had everything and the toiletries were nice. There were plenty of towels and two robes. There was a Nespresso coffee maker, with 3 capsules, one sachet of sugar and one creamer - not exactly generous for 2 guests! With some clever thinking and lots of patience we managed to make tea for us both- with our own bags.We had dinner the first night in the restaurant at street level. The burgers were very good, the service pleasant, and there was a nice cosy atmosphere. Later we  had a glass of wine  in the bar by reception, staring out at the view!We had breakfast two mornings at the restaurant, everything we tried was very good and the coffee nice. There was always a nice buzz and being at street level is pleasant. On the third morning we had breakfast at the pastry shop which can be accessed from the hotel. We had delicious cinammon rolls and coffee.We slept very well every night at the hotel, a comfy bed, just the right temperature. It was also very quiet, no noise from outside or neighbours. The staff was very pleasant, receptionists, porters, cleaners, restaurant staff.... but what made us really fall in love with this hotel was the view and its position. It is just a short walk from the nearest Loop station, right next to Michigan Avenue and the river.

Anyways, I didn't fight for it but the entire time while I was talking to him, he was not friendly at all, to top it off, he said that he could nt give me a printed receipt because their printer wasn't working. This was when I saw him print my receipt and put a note of late charge on it.So tips, if you're an HHonors member, just check out from your app, and don't bother checking out in the reception to avoid having the same experience as I did. Sadly, that's the last thing I remembered during my entire stay. It could have been totally awesome if not for the checkout experience.

I was booked in a One Bedroom Ciry View hotel room and it was so nice. The room furnishings are very modern but welcoming. The bathroom was spacious with luxurious toiletries. They also have service on the tv that you can launch Netflix which was nice to binge watch your favorite shows on a snowy day.I went down to Bridges Lobby Bar where I met a very attentive Bartender, Michele D.She made me the best French 75, that I enjoyed often the week I was there. She was always helpful in suggesting local spots for anything you want to do while in town. The decor is so classy, with an even more amazing view especially when the snow is coming down. It is a great place for a Business Metting, a Romantic Place for a weekend getaway and a great place to stop in even when you're not staying at the hotel. They have a limited menu for someone that may be picky like myself but the few things I ate, were very good. They had music which was very nice for the guests. They have a Rooftop Bar which was trendy and they have events in the Winter as well. They have a DJ on the weekends which was more of a nightclub environment if Horne into that kind of entertainment. I stayed for the week for work and had a flight cancellation my last day. They were very helpful to let me stay in my same room since it was last minute change. I got a chance to meet so many of the staff and that is why I have stayed at LH five more times this last six months. On my most recent trip in March 2019, I got to see some of my favorite staff members, Michelle and Abel and met a new Front Desk Staff Member, Trevor.

We didn't go to the rooftop bar because of the cold weather, but I can imagine that is nice. We also liked being able to get drinks in the lobby bar. Very chill area that has a cool look and bartender was great. The only thing is the line of people waiting for valet, uber, or cabs at the entrance. It was totally congested due to the size of the waiting area which is a floor lower than the lobby. People were trying to get in and get out through the same door--while valet tried to bring in luggage through a mass of people. Definitely was a little chaotic but not horrible. The valet team worked steadily to accommodate people. Front desk was courteous and pleasant. Only draw back is that they didn't add my points for not using the credit. I had to call Hilton Honors to fix that. The londonhouse isn't far from main attractions or shopping, although it's not exactly close to them either. Some walking involved to get to stores, etc. Great for a nice day in chicago--but in winter, you will probably catch a ride. Overall, this is definitely one of our top Chicago hotel visits.

This property is very popular, so I wasn’t sure there’d be a decent selection of rooms available, but I was pleasantly surprised. I booked a standard room and at arrival, they let me know the room I had selected in the e-check in wasn’t available yet but they could put me in a nicer room. I loved the layout of the room they gave me... it had a bit of a hallway that then circled back around for the room itself, which helped keep any sound from the hallway to a minimum. It was actually very quiet in the hotel which was nice. The view from the room overlooked Michigan Avenue and the river—quite nice.The bedding is always so comfortable and the room was clean and well apportioned. It’s a very modern hotel in a very classic building which is a hallmark of the Curio Collection from Hilton. WiFi worked well but I couldn’t get my premium WiFi to process since the system said my information didn’t match hotel records. I didn’t need to do any significant work on WiFi, so the standard service was sufficient.

I had a few hotel options in mind but landed on the LondonHouse as everything advertised about it online seemed pristine. From the outside it just looks like another regal building which keeps the inside feel exactly like a little slice of heaven. Everything marble and grandeur, very royal and timeless with a modernistic touch accompanied by the royal blue and sage green furniture pieces in the lounge/concierge area. Upon check in we had no issues, especially after the hotel staff helped us make the best of our trip. I purchased a room for a super affordable price but it turns out it was a handicapped room with no view. The concierge politely offered us an upgrade for only $50 more, extremely reasonable for what we got. We went up to our room and I was just amazed. We were in a corner room at the very end of our floor. When we walked in the room we saw the long hallway and thought no way this is the room we got for such an affordable price! The room came with a spacious sitting area and workspace. The king size bed was hidden behind the desk wall which had a large flat screen on the other side of it. Let's talk about the bed; amazing. There was so much space, fluffy pillows and soft linens, we thought we were sleeping on a cloud. The bathroom was spacious and came with eco-friendly fixtures. We had a surplus of towels which was convenient. They stocked us with fine toiletries from Malin + Goetz (a very reputable high end line). The closet was spacious with a safe, ironing board, and two complimentary robes. The best part, we had so many windows with a perfect view of the river.We were just blocks away from mag mile and minutes away from plenty of amazing restaurants; not that we needed to even leave as there is an amazing restaurant/bar in the hotel as well as an attached corner bakery. It was extremely easy to get an uber/taxi in the area and we were able to get to all the places we wanted to go. Even so, we spent all night in the room, it was perfect.Our check out process was smooth and they even held our bags for us while we went to brunch.

When I went to buy a drink, I was greeted by a bartender named D, who was extraordinarily pleasant herself.

We didn't have enough time this trip, but were often told the architecture boat tour is a must. We did do the on-off bus tour (right around the corner) and that was great and worth the $45/person.

Excellent smart elevators to help mitigate traffic on a multiuse revamp of a gorgeous historical building. Room size adequate but lacking in proper business space to get real work accomplished. Lighting is great for sexy time but no bueno for working. The bedding was A+ as was the mattress. Great closet space. Fabulous views of the river and the fabulous Trump Hotel & Tower (that’s a five star hotel!), friendly staff . What they got wrong: From check in, the staff was friendly but in a autopilot sort of way. It was clear I was exhausted and tired from traveling, there was literally a full service bar right next to check in and never once was I offered water, coffee, nothing that is basic from a 4-5 star hotel. I even said I was so thirsty when asked how I was that day. The guest to my right checking in offered me one of their cokes to which I looked at the staff member checking in like...would you like to offer your own version of hospitality? ...nothing! Lol In fact he told them how nice they were to offer and we all giggled at his response. He didn’t get it. Then this was odd he asked like most hotels to get a cell number for me so they can have contact info on file, but then the whole dang hotel was texting me asking me how I was doing. It was a bit annoying and felt like an odd invasion of my privacy, but I ended up having fun with it. They should be more clear that the crew plans to text you throughout your stay. Going on the the accommodations. No one offered to take my things to my room, ok fine but that’s def not 4 star. Next the bathroom, if you’re going to have a sexy bathroom with frosted walls you must separate the commode in its own private room with a door. Nothing sexy about having guest over and hearing and seeing them do their business. Lighting was confusing to figure out, it’s like early 2000’s high tech, dimmers everywhere no master control for room as a whole like at the Trump . No pool, no spa. Yes, having spa services like massage people on call with a couple of empty rooms is not a spa! Fitness center was an after thought, not good. My room wasn’t completely ready I had to snag glass and coffee supplies off the maid service cart. The worst was the bar, poor service very slow, rude cocktail hostesses and bartender with watered down drinks. Now I visited in winter Ave their outdoor roofbar is what they are known for so maybe this was the B team holding up the winter fort. But it was my only experience and it was expensive and bad. The food wasn’t horrible but not great and presentation was very bleak. This hotel is nice for a quick weekend trip in Summer Fall when you plan to be outside more than inside but If are here in winter, you want a great gym/pool/spa and onsite fab dining because it’s sucks going out in Chicago in the winter. So that being said visit this place in Summer for fun, not for business, friendly enough, staff great views, bedding and visuals, but you’ll want to go out to eat, drink, and be entertained. A decent 3 Star place.",,,,,,,March 2019,Traveled on business,12,2.0

When we arrived our room wasn’t ready yet, so we checked our bags and wandered around the city, the hotel texted us when it was ready.  We had a great room overlooking the river.  The room had a separate living room area with a couch and tv, which made it great if one of us had problems sleeping we could get up and watch tv with the door closed so no waking the one still sleeping.  The room was very clean.  There were carolers walking around the lobby singing Christmas tunes.  The roof top bar was awesome with excellent views of the city.

We were glad we picked London House and stayed here for 3 days. The service, room, and dining quality went above and beyond our expectations. As a diamond member, I highly recommend this hotel. They tried their best to attend to our needs. Knowing that we have special room request and a late flight, they made proper arrangements that made the trip much easier for us. I am happy that I have Hilton status and they value it. When booking, I was concerned about the size of the room, but it turnes out it wasn't as bad as the reviews said. The amenities provided such as room slippers, loofah, body lotion, and sparling water were such a treat to our stay. I also enjoyed my time at the hotel gym. Equipment was new and perfect for my weight-lifting routine.Also I liked the lobby cafe and Lank and Lake Kitchen. I had wines and tea when friends were visiting at the lobby cafe. The breakfast was served until 11:30 which I didn't feel rushed and enjoyed a late breakfast. The options were wide spread and healthy. My favorite was avocado and bread.Overall, it was a luxury and enjoyable stay. You will definitely enjoy the status benefits.",,,,,,,March 2019,Traveled with friends,300,106.0

Great lobby bar scene and a convenient restaurant at the base of the hotel for stop-in breakfast (I did find the service a tad slow, but this restaurant is not affiliated with the hotel). Room: king bed, large space for the city, comfortable, plenty of room, corner location with neat views.Bed: comfortable, I wouldn’t say luxurious, but I had no issues with sleep quality. Bathroom: shower-only setup, large and nice. Heat/AC: room temp seemed to be easily controlled, no issues here. Amenities: I needed more hangars but probably just me, mini fridge discreetly hidden, great room cleaning service everyday, gym was small with only a couple free weighs (no machines), but plenty of treadmills/bikes/row machine for my early AM workouts.

The hotel has managed to retrofit an office building with rooms and it really works well. There is no lobby on the ground floor as it is located in a very nice area on the first floor - which smells amazing. The bar and seating area was great and the layout worked perfectly with windows overlooking the street. The lifts are the type that you tell it where you are going and it tells you which lift to take - my one issue with this is that is does not really count the number of people getting in so sometimes it was a little crowded. Our room was very nice, though I think it used to be an elevator itself. The noise from the other elevators going up and down could be heard, not awful but just in the background. We had paid on points so assumed it would not be the best room! The mattress in the room was amazing - one of the best we have slept in at a hotel for ages. The tv was great, the view over the road to the trump hotel was good. The bathroom has a barn type door, not our favorite, but it worked well. We wished that there were more hooks in the bathroom for hanging towels and that towels could be reused - we had new towels everyday. Hooks by the door would have also been very useful in the winter weather. The best thing about this hotel was the service - it was amazing. We had an issue with a bedding change request and the manager downstairs solved the issue and got us a beverage - really , really great. Every employee we interacted with was amazing and friendly.

The lifts were something I had never seem before, you typed in your destination on the keypad outside the lift and you were then directed to the relevant lift to your floor. Very efficient. There is also a roof top bar which was not open when we were staying but we were able to have a look and i could imagine it being lovely to have a cocktail on a summer evening, watching the world below go by. There was also a lovely bar in the reception area and another on the ground floor.The bell staff on the ground floor who are on the door constantly, helping with luggage, giving advice on where to go and directions were very friendly, always welcoming you back and a real asset to the hotel.

Can’t say enough nice things about the staff and our stay!  When we checked in on February 14th- there was a slight glitch in the way our reservation was booked- due to using points and paying for one night. Trevor fixed us up- got us on the 20th floor- with a great view of the river.  He went above and beyond to make sure we were taken care of. We had a mishap with our Amtrak reservation- that caused us to have to depart early Sunday morning vs our planned late check out -  We had paid for breakfast & a late check out. Once again- Trevor and Andrew were able to accommodate our needs. Upon check in and check out- due to having to wait for the issues to be solved ( which didn’t take long) Trevor gave us a few drink passes for the bar.  The bar and view were awesome- and so was Michelle. She took great care of us- and gave us great suggestions for drinks- and things to do / see while in Chicago.  Also- there was some live music in the bar -Mike Hayes I believe was his name. What a voice!! This guy is was great.Our room was clean, comfortable & quiet. Awesome view- loved the Nespresso coffee maker -  55 inch tv’s & comfy bed and linens. I want to thank Trevor, Andrew and Michelle for taking great care of us during our Honeymoon stay.

Great location with the most amazing views of the city! We had a corner room and the views are just something else. Defo recommend paying that bit extra for the corner view. You can see everything! The room was clean and modern. Quite small for the price but we weren’t in it that much. Bathroom is beautiful. So modern and a giant walk in shower. Really one of the nicest bathrooms I’ve stayed in. There wasn’t a lot of staff around in the hotel. Seemed to be only door men and then the guys at the check in. We ate downstairs at the restaurant for a quick bite before we left for the night. Amazing Parmesan fries and chicken wings and nice drink specials. After we got back we decided to try the rooftop bar. We didn’t feel comfortable at all. I mean we were dressed nice and we are usually comfortable in fashionable bars but this was so stuffy and felt like every eye was on you as soon as you entered. It didn’t seem to be hotel guests that were at the bar more just other patrons. We left as soon as we got there. We did check out the rooftop for views and it was amazing. Just amazing. You need to go up and take some pics. Room service stopped at 10. This was really annoying as we wanted a drink in our room. So we had to pay the over the top prices from the bar up stairs and bring them down. Overall a great stay the views really are worth it.,,,,,,,February 2019,Traveled as a couple,85,4.0

Usually hotels in historic buildings have elevators that are inefficient.  The elevators at LondonHouse route riders based on their requested floor and so no one has to wait an exorbitant amount of time to get where you're going.  This is particularly convenient during checkout hours.  Also, there are 2 entrances to the hotel, one from Wacker and another from N. Michigan.

We were able to easily park and unload when arriving and did the same upon checkout with ease. The valets were kind and helpful. As was all of the staff. Check-in was simple and we were greeted by several kind employees. My friend was even able to checkout a phone converter from the the concierge - super accommodating! Our room was very clean and spacious. We had a great view of the river even from a ""partial view"" room. It would definitely be a fun place to stay for St. Patrick's Day! Don't miss out on the rooftop. We were there in December so we didn't do drinks up there but the views were breathtaking and made even better with the Christmas lights. The bar was nice for a drink before bed however, the service was lacking and almost rude. Also, our drinks were not the best. I have never ordered a coffee and Bailey's and gotten it served cold? Perhaps, just a miscommunication on my end but again, I've never had it served that way so it was a bit off putting.

From the windows, I could see down the river which was spectacular.  The room was clean and very comfortable. Then, my daughter got lost driving in from Indiana and Mark, a bellman, helped me on and off for over forty minutes to help my daughter find her way.  Mark was finally able to get her location close enough to the hotel so we took off running to get to her.  If it wasn't for Mark I don't know what I would have done.  I have never stayed in a hotel that has gone above and beyond for me and Mark did that which reflects well on the LondonHouse.

We had a great time in Chicago and big part of that was thanks to the hotel we stayed in.LondonHouse is extremely conveniently located. We went to the city from the airport by train which is not only cheap but also much better way of getting to the loop. It took about 45 minutes to get from the airport to Washington station and about 7 minutes walk to the hotel. We have got to the hotel around midday and our room was not ready yet but we have pre checked in, left the luggage and were told that we will receive the message once the room will be ready. About one hour later we have received the text. We stayed in one of the vista rooms and I have to say that it is worth every penny. The view from it is amazing. Our room was located on the 6th floor and after couple of days we have moved to floor 15. Both were great, but the higher you go the quieter it gets. Rooms are very clean and spacious. Hotel is located extremely conveniently to enjoy the city. Many attractions are within walking distances and if they are not there is an bus stop right outside with the choice of lines and the “L” train is less than 5 minutes walk.Even the famous Andy’s Jazz Bar is 10 minutes walk as well as many more bars and clubs.What also make LondonHouse great place to stay is the employees. All of the staff where extremely helpful and friendly.

Both good reasons individually but when combined made it irresistible. We wanted to be right in the mix of things in this vibrant city and LondonHouse Chicago was spot on and perfect for our needs. The hotel is located on the corner of Michigan Avenue and Wacker Drive and sitting beside the Chicago River and right in the heart of Chicago’s premium shops and restaurants. Our King Bed Vista Room had a fantastic view of the Chicago River, and was typical for this type of upscale Hilton. The room was comfortable and well fitted out with all the usual facilities but we found clothes storage a little too minimal. The bed was very comfortable and we both slept well during our stay and our large bathroom, with a really good walk-in shower, was just about perfect. The room was also complete with the usual complimentary tea/coffee, flat screen TV and Wi-Fi and safe. All fixtures and fittings were of really good quality too and generally the accommodations were great.We did not eat in the hotel so we cannot comment on the catering services. However, there are a plethora of restaurants and bars in the area so dining out is easy but not cheap. But with a little effort you can find local gems to dine that won’t break the bank while enjoying this great city.

I cannot emphasize enough what an ideal location the hotel occupies.  Situated right at the corner of Michigan Avenue and the river (Wacker Dr.), it is a perfect launching point for any of the downtown adventures.  You can walk practically everywhere, whether north or south of the river, the theater district, Millenium Park, Symphony Hall, Magnificent Mile shopping.  Befitting of hotel named after London, there is a Nando's practically across the street as well so many dining options at many different price points within walking distance (even on a December day).  The restaurant on the main floor was excellent for breakfast, but that is the only meal I tried there.  I did not try room service, but the bar on the second floor was quite good with ample, comfortable seating and both a bartender and attentive server.  There is also a rooftop bar which I did not try, but looked very nice.The staff in every detail was not only friendly but genuinely proud of this hotel.  I got a text from them once or twice a day asking how the stay was going, and any questions were answered quickly and courteously.The rooms are very comfortable and quiet.  While I wouldn't call them spacious, they also weren't cramped; and they were beautifully appointed.  It had a safe, a fridge (with a quick-cool setting), and what appeared to be an espresso machine, although I didn't use it.  The bathroom was lovely and modern, and the shower was excellent--firm flow of water through a rain-style shower head.  The bath products provided were also excellent.  I have read some questions/concerns about the elevators.  They are a little different, but I grew to like them.  Instead of pressing an up or down button, you actually enter your floor # on a touchscreen, and the panel tells you which elevator to go to.  It took me a time or two to appreciate that I knew which of the 10 elevators would be opened and then could queue at the correct one.  Do be aware (trigger warning...) that the LondonHouse is right across the river from the Trump Hotel.  They were able to accomodate my request for a room that didn't look at that ugly, bloated building.  Instead, I had a beautiful view of the Wrigley building, the Tribune building and the Apple Store--did you know that the roof of the Apple Store is an inverted iPad?  Brilliant.Thanks again to the LondonHouse staff and their manager.  This is my new top choice for hotels in Chicago.",5.0,,5.0,5.0,,,December 2018,Traveled on business,33,23.0

The employees went above and beyond. We were thanked numerous times for being Diamond members. Our room was upgraded and we had an amazing view. The shower was huge! There was also a cappuccino machine in the room. I highly recommend this hotel. It was superb in every way.,,,,,,,December 2018,Traveled as a couple,3,

My Girlfriend and I spent weeks looking at various hotels in the area that we wanted to stay and after slowly dwindling the number of hotels down we found ourselves left with just two. I'm originally from England so ""London House"" in pure name won the battle.First the facts! It's location is quite simply perfect. You are 10 - 15 minutes walk from so many amazing things to see and do and even after that you are a short 10 cab ride from everything else you could possibly want to see or do. The hotel as a whole is very clean and presentable. The door staff as you arrive set the stage for the pleasant experience that you are going to have throughout your stay. We arrived at 9pm at night and found a friendly and efficient front desk person who offered us a discounted upgrade which sadly we were unable to take advantage of. However the process of checking in was very quick and smooth. Gotta love that smile!Upon getting into the room I noticed that we didn't have a safe in the room. As I travel with a lot of camera equipment a safe is a priority for me. After a phone call down to the front desk a friendly gentlemen arrived at our door less than twenty minutes later with a safe in tow. Just a couple of minutes later he was leaving the room with a friendly smile job done.One of the highlights of the stay for us was ""Mark"" the bellman. Mark was always a friendly guy to chat with while waiting for a cab or my girlfriend to come downstairs. He offered some great advise on places to eat and even on our last day helped us arrange for a car to the airport. He and all the bell staff were quite simply on point. I travel a fair amount for work and I've seen some of the best hotels at their worst moments but I can't honestly say I didn't have a single bad thing happen throughout my stay here. I can not recommend this hotel experience more to anyone coming to Chicago. Chicago is the cupcake but London House makes for the perfect icing on the package.P.S. Do not forget to check out the roof top patio for some awesome views and those ever important Instagram/Facebook picsP.P.S We are hoping to return to Chicago in February 2019 for another week and if we do, and can afford it, we will definitely be staying back at this wonderful hotel.Gary",,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,November 2018,Traveled as a couple,3,

The London House is in a great location.  It’s close enough to everything you’d want to visit yet feels like it’s hidden away.  It’s within walking distance to our favorite places: the theater district, shopping, Millennium Park, Magnolia Bakery and the Christkindlmarket in Daley Plaza. For the most part, we had a beautiful view.  The rooftop views are amazing as well.  There is no charge to go up to the rooftop bar like there can be at other hotels.  You can go up there just to check out the city views. We had a room with two double beds. The four individual reading lights are a nice touch.  There were lots of pillows and lots of towels, which was a nice change from our usual amenities.Our main reason for going to the London House was because of Trevor Strahan.  We met Trevor at another hotel years ago.  His personality and hospitality skills are outstanding!  When we found out he was going to be working at the London House, we switched our reservation from our usual hotel.  It’s nice to be the guest of someone who recognizes you.  That’s hard to come by in a city as big as Chicago full of so many hotels.  His smile is contagious.  His professionalism is unbeatable.

I usually tend to stay in hotels right off the Mag. Mile, further north, but I decided that the convenience of the Blue Line on this leisure trip to get to/from O'Hare, in addition to current Hhonors promotions, made it worth trying this Curio (I'd also never tried this relatively new brand of Hilton). Let me be completely honest. This is a beautifully-restored hotel. The photos from travellers speak for themselves. What lets it down is some, not all, of its staff members. I had chosen my room through the Hhonors App and opted for a digital key. You usually get a notification when this key is delivered to you. Since I didn't get any notification and took a wild guess that something was glitching, I proceeded to the front desk to retrieve some keycards. The greeting I got was snooty and frankly, not reflective of the kind of service this level of property should provide. I was being polite and waited to be called by one of the two gentlemen manning the desk that evening. My ""good evening, how are you?"", was met with a disinterested ""good, last name?"", no welcome, not even an attempt at small talk back to make a guest feel welcomed. They say non-verbal makes up for a lot... Couldn't even crack a smile. Upon giving that to him, I then received a reply that went along ""oh, you checked-in already"", to which I replied I had but hadn't received the digital key notification. He appeared puzzled, as if this had never happened before or I was making something up. I was handed over keys and asked if I needed anything else. I asked if my room choice was decent or at least had some kind of view (the hotel is greatly placed that almost all rooms should have a decent view) and I was told that ""all the standard rooms were the same, they're all really nice rooms, but that for 50% off, I could upgrade"". I declined and proceeded to my room. The view was good, but partly obstructed by the architectural features of the building, which rooms a few floors below probably do not have, but I guess that was too much for that front desk staff member to bother mentioning when I specifically asked that question. I only returned to the front desk and one of the original two staff members that was there during my check-in glanced over while the other gentleman I was dealing with was attempting to find directions with a clearly annoyed ""oh why don't you just get a taxi/Uber look"". Those two shouldn't be in the hospitality industry. Sharply dressed, good-looking people, but clearly, focused on style over substance. Neither could've cracked a smile if you had tried hard. HHonors water was never offered or delivered for status members. App check-out worked, but the folio/bill was never e-mailed to me as it should. Had to call again to get a copy. Linens were amazingly soft, and so was the bed (some may not like it). Good quality bath products. An odd heater in the bathroom ceiling that you could not turn on. Maintenance when contacted over the phone said it should start with the room's climate control but who wants to turn their room up to 25-26C/78-80F just so that the bathroom heating fan can start. Odd. On another note, room service was reasonably priced, but I never actually got a chance to try it. Location-wise, as mentioned before, it's very convenient to the airport by CTA Blue Line, and strategically placed right at the start of the Magnificent Mile, yet, it's less than 5-6 minutes on foot to Grant/Millenium Park and about 7-8 minutes to Chicago's very authentic (and busy!) Christmas market. Had it not been for the poor check-in experience and subsequent directions request at the front desk, I would've likely given it a 4 or a 5. I had no desire to have further interaction with their staff after that. I have to say, I usually agree with most reviewers when the consensus is that the staff is great, as it is here in lots of reviews, but I did not have that experience. The person I spoke to to get my folio after check-out was actually very nice, so perhaps I happened to bump into the two snobs that were having a bad day. Good-looking people, but I'd rather have friendly, approachable staff rather than models checking me in. It's back to the EMC2 for me when looking for unique accomodation in Chicago. They have both great facilities AND great staff.",,5.0,2.0,,,5.0,November 2018,Traveled with friends,94,130.0

This time, we were in the “new tower,” unlike on that first stay, when we had a corner room, in the original building. Now, the LondonHouse occupies two adjoining structures, but it’s not so evident which of the two, one is in. It’s not really until one views the outside facade, that it becomes clear where the “historic tower” ends, and the “new tower” begins. Now, the rooms differed, as we did not have a corner this time, so only one window, looking down to the River, and across to the Miracle Mile skyline. The general layout was pretty much the same, and was basically the “Hilton Corporate King Room.” Except for the Curio Collection décor (a bit more “modernist”), it could have been almost any Hilton in the USA.Still, room 2005 was comfortable, with a nice King bed, a chair, desk, lamps and closet. The bathroom was an “upgrade” from normal Hilton bathrooms, and featured a “roll-in shower,” as it is at least partially an ADA room. The only downside is that the sink vanity is small, to allow more space, for say a wheelchair. For some reason, Hilton thinks that when we request a “walk-in shower,” we need one with wheelchair access, which is not the case. The issues that we have with ADA rooms, is that first we are taking one, that a disabled guest might need, and then many of the fixtures are not comfortable for us, such as the small vanity, then very low hangers in closets, etc. I need to work with Hilton a bit more closely, and explain that we are ONLY requesting a walk-in shower, and need nothing else. Actually, the request for a walk-in is just for convenience sake for my wife, with two artificial hips. Still, even with the little accommodations for a wheelchair-bound guest, 2005 was a nice, and comfortable room.Once more, the service by the hotel staff, from the doormen to the reservations desk, to the two bars, and the restaurant, was great. Everyone was very friendly, and we wanted for nothing during this rather short stay.With rather gloomy weather, it was nice to have the excellent Lobby Bar, and then at LH on 21, the upper-floor “pub.” I did get to explore LH on 22, the rooftop area, but due to the weather, it was basically closed down. One morning, I tried the ground-level restaurant, Land & Lake, which was OK, though the service was friendly and efficient. I was happy to have the Lobby Bar, and explored their entire wine list – plus I did the same for LH on 21.The location is excellent (more so for us, as my wife’s meetings were just around the corner), with shopping, and so many tourists attractions, basically out of the front door. During our stay, with the exception of one night’s dinner, we walked to everything we wished to see, and I got to explore the Chicago River Walkway, in yet another Season.We are returning to the LondonHouse in a month, and looking forward to the stay.",,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,October 2018,Traveled on business,166281,2721.0

The first night of my stay was one that still causes me so much distress. At 1:00 am, I heard a few knocks on our door. I woke up to listen what the situation was and if it was a drunk person trying to prank us or find their room. NOPE! This knock also occurred to the two rooms besides us. The knocking began to become more aggressive. When I got up to quietly walk to the door, I didn't see a silhouette of the persons feet so I thought they went away. As I looked out of the peep hole, the person put a reverse peep hole viewer on my door and saw I was trying to seem. (this was by far the most scariest thing I have ever experienced). Once the person saw me, they were POUNDING on the door so hard I thought it was going to break off the hinges. At one point they even threw themselves into door. I called the Front Desk and was put on hold for 13 minutes to ask them to send Security. 13 minutes is a long time when you're heart is racing and getting ready to defend your self out of deep sleep and ensure your safety. At this point, I was never going to open the door because the person was hiding their identity. The front desk said they would check the cameras and have security walk the floor. After I hung up with the front desk, the knocking had gone away and it was now 2am. One full hour of panic and distress. The front desk never called my room back to ensure I was safe and I never heard security in the hallway. It was impossible to fall asleep after that. In the morning I carefully walked out of my hotel room, which no one should ever have a fear of doing if this is a highly rated hotel. I scanned the hallways and elevators on my way down to the Lobby. NO SECURITY CAMERAS! For some, I can understand that is a privacy concern but for me, that is a HUGE PROBLEM! When I spoke to the Hotel Manager, he said he would check with the night manager and see if anyone else complained. He switched our rooms to help ease us. The second night, I didn't hear form any of the hotel staff about the situation. Was my concern dismissed? The last morning, I spoke to the Hotel Manager to see if he had any information, all he could say was ""there were a lot of people walking in and out of the hotel at that hour of the night and it is hard to pinpoint"". The Hotel Manager has a second opportunity to provide me with some closure but did a terrible job. The hotel did not have key card access points which is another fault in the hotel. Anyone could have walked in the building at 3am and gone to any floor. I'm not sure how such a nice hotel could lack Security and Hospitality. I am extremely disappointed with this hotel and its guests safety. I will never stop telling this story because this experience haunts me.",2.0,,1.0,,,1.0,November 2018,Traveled with family,1,18.0

I was given a complimentary drink from their beautiful bar, and that was courtesy of the concierge and that person was Anthony.  Anthony was very nice to me and they even gave me some delicious truffles as a present in my room.

I told them that it was fine to leave it in the room . Now that's great hospitality!!!!  The rooms are great .

The service here is classy and the ambiance brings a different level of the big city Chicago vibe. When first walking in we were always kindly greeted and assisted by Firkrut, the gentleman that was always working the front entrance. We first visited the LondonHouse late October of 2017 and we knew immediately that this was the location for us. We reached out via email through the LondonHouse homepage and we received a prompt response from the Director of Weddings, Steve Slecka. At our first and several meetings, Steve was awesome to talk with. He took us step by step through the entire process. The complimentary cocktails every visit also helped up calm our nerves. Not to get side tracked, but if you find yourself at the lobby bar, be sure to ask Kurt to whip up a Blueberry Vesper. After about 4 of them you won’t even care about how much they cost. Kurt is also the most happy go lucky person I have ever encountered. Our wedding was not the traditional sit down and be served style. The setup in the Juliette Grand Ballroom was very beautiful. The floor to ceiling windows gave everybody an awesome view over the bridges and river.  We opted for food stations, open seating and a handful of tall boy tables to stand at. A few guests were confused at first but there was plenty of staff members directing the way to point guests into the right direction. The food stations allowed our guests to flow freely and not to have to wait in a buffet line, wait for a table number to be called, or have the traditional 1000 course sit down meal that takes forever. The chef also allowed us to add a few items that were not on the menu.  We needed up with 3 food stations and a sweets table.Station #1 - Asian-Lo mein noodles served in white Chinese takeout boxes-Teriyaki chicken and Jasmine rice-Veggie egg rolls and sweet and sour sauce-Cucumber saladStation #2 - Mexican-Steak tacos-Fries white fish tacos-Walking tacos with pastor pork-Large salsa selection Station #3 - American-Crab cake sliders-Prime beef sliders-Korean short rib sliders-French friesSweets Station-Cupcakes-Key lime pie-Flan-CoffeeThe food did not come out in mass amounts and it was continuously replenished and remained fresh throughout the entire dinner. The Banquet Manager, Danielle and her team did a great job in hosting a very well out together reception. I’d also like to mention that the menu tasting prior to the wedding was also very fun and her staff was very attentive and friendly. We also had a separate late night arrival party of coworkers that arrives around 8:30-9. These guests were greeted with a freshly prepared food box.The Presidential Suite was a comfortable room. It was very high class. There was a fire place built in the middle of the living room and a tv mounted on each side  creating 2 separate living rooms. All of the curtains were power operated, the showers was large and had 3 separate shower heads, the bedroom was nice and it also had a sofa, and the kitchenette had a mini fridge, sink, dishwasher, plenty of cabinet space and a espresso machine.Overall, we are extremely pleased with our entire stay from Friday to Monday. We had a total of 5 rooms books and nobody had a complaint. Our Moms were both upgraded to a suite and both were sent complimentary water and a fruit bowl. In total, our guests had 25 rooms booked on a group block. I’d highly recommend getting the rooms booked early because we did run out of rooms and the hotel became booked before we could get more rooms. We were warned ahead of time but we did not act quick enough. Our family was happy with the stay and definitely impressed with the LondonHouse and the location. Even upon our checkout, the bellman Corey remembered us from when he first met us during our check in. He made my mom laugh a little bit by letting my Mom believe that we were regulars. Don’t hesitate to reach out to Steve about anything you need. He was always ready to answer all of our questions no matter how minor or major they were.Kevin and Mari#justbefranks",,,,,,,October 2018,Traveled with family,15,5.0

The hotel is chic, well located, and had excellent customer service. I was upgraded to premium internet because of my special event. The room, once you can get through the heavy wood door, was spacious and well laid out. I had a vista view which looked out to the river and the Trump tower. The beds slept comfortably and there was a huge mirror outside the bathroom (and one on the closet door which is nice when you have multiple people primping). The toiletries were of high quality and toothbrush kits and a loofah were provided. Still, I felt underwhelmed by this hotel given its class designation. The room lighting was quite dim for my preference even with the large window.There is a large shower stall in the bathroom and motion lighting which is quite nice for those early morning bathroom trips.The bathroom has a sliding barn door closure that did not allow for much privacy because there was a gap where you could see and hear everything happening in the room (and vice versa). Add to that no fan in the bathroom to mask bathroom noise. I would take function over cute design any day when it comes to the bathroom. Because we were sharing a bathroom, the lack of storage was difficult. There was one hook but no towel racks on which to hang towels and wash cloths. The bathroom space is plentiful enough to accommodate racks and this would be a strong suggestion for management to consider. All in all, I found the room nice enough but I didn't feel like I had upgraded to a luxury hotel. A couple of nicer amenities does not make up for the absence of basic functionality.",,,,,,,October 2018,,5,6.0

However, the service at this hotel is poor. We were staying for 4 nights which had been booked in 3 separate bookings because my employer had booked the middle 2 nights for me. I am a Hilton honours member and all 4 nights were paid up front. I called the hotel ahead of arrival (incurring an overseas phone charge) to explain the 3 bookings and asked for them to be linked so that we didn’t have to keep checking-in and out. I was told this would be done so long as both my husband and my names were on each booking - I made sure that this was in place. However when my husband arrived at the hotel to check-in it had not been done. The receptionist then took a while to link the bookings and the whole check-in process was more stressful than it should have been. Worse was then to come when the following day the key to the room stopped working. This meant another trip to reception who said that the bookings were still not linked and the key had to be re-issued. Believe it or not the same thing then happened 2 days later and we had to go back to reception again for the same reason. It should not be difficult for a hotel of this standard to link 3 bookings and ensure their customer doesn’t have to keep returning to the desk. Furthermore the reception staff each time were at best indifferent and at worse unhelpful.The room was fine but not special and avoid the diner at ground level - the food is average and the service is terrible. We saw two different people have wait staff bump into them causing drinks to be spilled. We had to ask 3 times for milk for the coffee and that was after them losing track of their wait list and seating people out of order.There are plenty of choices of this type of hotel in downtown Chicago - I’d try somewhere else.",,,,,,,October 2018,Traveled as a couple,58,24.0

The reason: It's not a restored hotel but a restored office building. What that means to guests is immediately obvious: No grand lobby, in fact, pretty much no lobby at all. Registration and coffee service and such are instead ensconced on the second floor, and are utilitarian, lacking in any pizzaz. That's a negative, as is the room size--which runs small for a luxury property. Aside from these quibbles, LH is a great place to stay in Chicago. It could hardly be located any better for access to Chicago's shopping, eateries, sites, and shores. And it shines most brightly in service, which is the best I've experienced in my many Chicago hotel stays. Housekeeping managed to make up my room despite my giving them narrow windows to do their work. And brilliant use of texting helped me immeasurably, as I texted a variety of requests and questions at all hours--including 2:30 am. I always got prompt, accurate answers--from Abel, Ricardo, Saif, Grace, and TJ. One more small but meaningful plus: room lighting that offered nearly limitless combinations of bright lights and low lights and task lights and reading lights and automatic lights and...well, you get my drift.

The lobby is beautiful and the lobby bar/restaurant has great food and drinks starting at 6 in the morning.  The rooftop restaurant and bar is also excellent, and offers some fantastic views of Chicago.The location is great, right on the river between Wacker and Michigan.  You can easily access the Riverwalk, and it is walking distance to The House of Blues, the Apple Store and several of the sightseeing river boats.I noticed that one reviewer downgraded the hotel because they didn't like the elevators.  This might be because they are different - you select your destination floor on a touch panel, then you are directed to your elevator, which has no floor buttons in it.  There is a display in the door frame that indicates the floor the elevator is heading to. These ""smart elevators"" are different, but they are also faster and more efficient, and often more secure.  Is it really a good idea to hate things you don't understand?  I don't think so.We found the staff to be courteous, helpful and quick to respond to our requests.  Check-in was a breeze and the doorman and bellhops were very helpful, not just with bags, but with directions and guidance.When we are in Chicago, this is where we will stay!",5.0,,5.0,,5.0,,September 2018,Traveled as a couple,156,16.0

Terrible elevator situation! Normal rooms!","Upon arriving at the London House in Chicago we thought our experience was going to be outstanding given the hype around this hotel. The hotel is quite cool. It is fancy and has a rooftop with an amazing view. However, as cool as the rooftop might be it causes a lot of trouble for actual guests staying at the hotel.The elevator situation was beyond terrible. They give preference to the rooftop for the use of elevators. The elevator hall is packed with people, making it not only hard but uncomfortable waiting for an elevator with your bags. More so, the wait is incredibly long which forms a queue of people that all want to get to their rooms.The view from the rooftop was quite cool, but I payed for a hotel room not for a rooftop to make my stay unpleasant. Even getting from street level to the reception is a chaos thanks to the elevator situation.I have to say that the restaurant in the first floor was quite good for brunch and service there was amazing. Aside from that I was not utterly impressed. The rooms were average. The hotel is noisy. I've stayed at many hotels in Chicago and London House is now on my blacklist.

We paid 1.400$ as 14 100 dolars bills.After 7 nights, since we did not have any extra expense, on our checking out date we demanded our deposit.And we were very very suprised while we saw 1400 1$ !!!! Yes!! They brought our money as a dolar bills. When we saw money bundles, we’re totally shocked!! We had a flight to Turkey in 3 hours therefore we stated that we can not accept the money like that, we demanded our money as we paid but they did not help us and the managers of the reception ( we checked out on 15 th september at 9 am, the hotel administrators can determine the managers’names by this date and time) said that “these is the only money we can pay you” rudely. And added “If you don’t accept these money, we can not pay your deposit”We had 2 hours at the reception and because of their rude attitute we were nearly late for our flight.

When I say that this is one of the nicest hotels in the Curio Collection portfolio, I mean it. The location of the hotel alone makes it worth a stay, as it offers pristine views of Wacker Drive and the downtown Skyline of Chicago. I arrived to the hotel easily via Uber and although there is a valet option available, I would not recommend driving unless one is familiar with driving in Chicago. I was promptly greeted by a friendly and courteous LH doorman who offered to bring my bag up to my room for me. Upon checking in at the front desk, my Diamond elite status was acknowledged and I was granted the Digital Key (nice feature of Hilton Honors app). My room was an upgraded room on the 16th floor which they called a “Vista Room” and offered spectacular views down Wacker Drive. The room itself was very comfortable with two queen beds and a sitting area near a large window. There were premium toiletries in the bathroom and the bathroom itself was appointed with modern touches throughout. One thing that isn’t to be missed when staying at the LH is a visit to the rooftop bar/restaurant. I took advantage of the rooftop amenities to meet with an advisor of mine, and while the views were incredible, the service was impeccable and prompt. The gym facilities at the LH are as good as any gym, and there is also a day spa on-site which I was not able to take advantage of on my short stay.

The staff was so attentive and on top of it.  When we pulled up for the event, the valets were aware of the party and knew to give us the discounted rate. Then, we walked inside, someone greeted us and took us to a reserved elevator specifically for our party so our guests didn't have to wait in the line.  All of the staff was so gracious and responsive the entire event.  Also, the rooms themselves were fantastic.  We had a suite and the pull-out bed in the front room is American Leather.  Amazing!

Ken texted me to see how the room was.  During the show (Hamilton), I had forgotten the name of the restaurant he recommended so I texted back. A new person, TJ, said that Ken had left but got a hold of him, texted me back with the restaurant name and then made a reservation for us.  I felt extremely pampered.The room itself was lovely!  I really enjoyed the soft bed, roomy bathroom, and swanky toiletries.  The best part was the coffee though.

It was my boyfriends birthday and the front desk gentleman named Saif was very attentive and accommodating with our needs. He gave us a higher floor room with a city view as well as a late check out since we checked in a little later in the day. We were very appreciative of this upgrade. The only issues with the room was the air conditioning which kept going on and off and didn't maintain cold air through the night. Also, the toilet paper holder was slightly off so every time we rolled it, it would fall off which was a bit annoying but for a one night stay, we could deal with that. The rooftop is extraordinary with the amazing view and sofas and seating. The only downside of that was that it closes at midnight on a Saturday. It would've been nice if it stayed open just a little longer. The drinks were great and we had the burger with fries which was very delicious. It had sautéed onions which made it taste even better. Our waitress Rachel was very nice and took amazing care of us. At check out, Ken was very nice and gave us water when we requested it. He was very professional and attentive as well. More hotels needs employees such as these three mentioned. My favorite part of this hotel was the lobby which set off a comforting vibe. It was extremely inviting and such a chill area to be in. There was a chess table, which I played for the first time and although it took 2 hours to complete the game, I never once felt like leaving this area due to how comforting it was. Definitely will be back again. Thank you for everything.",,,5.0,4.0,,5.0,September 2018,Traveled as a couple,3,3.0

While the elevator banks are nice that you pick your floor, they were very slow. We had a king room on the 8th floor. The room was spotless and decorated tastefully. The entire hotel has a pleasant smell to it. The drawers in the bed bottom were a great touch. Bathroom is spacious with hot water and good water pressure. Linens are great and bed was very comfortable. Noise was minimal. This hotel is a 5 star hotel...the only thing that wasn't 5 star for my particular stay was that the room had recently been painted. Vents were missing and painters tape was still on the wall. Valet parking is also $86....we used Spothero and parked 3 minutes away for $45.

It was not, overall.  Good aspects:  Room was attractive and it was clean.  Valet was prompt.  Areas to improve:  The toilet should have flushed more efficiently.  I had to push in the handle for an excessive amount of time for it to flush completely.  The pillows were too soft.  At this price, I expected a combination of firmness so that I could choose the firmness that accommodated my needs.  The restaurant on the 21st floor had plenty of people working, but only one server seemed to be actually paying attention to guests, and she was accommodating, but overworked.  As a Silver Hilton Honors member, I was due two bottles of water upon check-in, which I was not offered. (I didn't realize this offer was open until I re-read my reservation confirmation a day after I checked in.)  The Digital Key did not work immediately, but worked about an hour after I checked in, then functioned properly.   Again, at this price point, I expect things to run smoothly.

Being one floor below the 21st-floor bar was sometimes loud but bearable. We knew going in that might be the case when staying one floor below. At times there were waits for the elevators but we didn't consider this unusual as the hotel was very busy. The rooftop bar was fantastic though we recommend getting reservations far in advance. It's certainly worth it just for the view. The lobby bar staff was friendly and quick in getting our drinks. The entire staff was friendly from the people on the street all the way to the housekeeping staff--and everyone in between. We had some small issues on arrival which were quickly addressed by the courteous and efficient management staff. When in Chicago we have always stayed at the Palmer House--another Hilton property. We love it there but the LHH has now become our first choice. Our biggest disappointment was their inability to control the 90-plus degree outside temperatures and the rain.

The hotel has a historic feel and the rooms are fresh and clean. Room coverings, furniture and amenities are upscale. I was fortunate to have a room with a nice view of the river, though I imagine all rooms have nice views of the city. The exercise facility is nice, though not big. Also, don't miss the rooftop bar, where you get incredible views of the river and Chicago. The hotel is in a great location with excellent bars and restaurants within minutes walking distance in every direction. Be mindful of the elevators that ask you to enter your floor then tell you what elevator to go to. It will catch you off guard if you're not paying attention. Also, the elevators are a little loud and can be distracting if you have a room near the elevators.Overall, the Londonhouse is a choice hotel in Chicago and is my new go-to for my trips to the city.

Best of the best!!,"A hotel can be incredible and have all the bells & whistles, but if the beds aren’t comfortable, does it really matter? You won’t have that problem at LondonHouse Chicago, since one look at the beds and we could tell they were going to be comfortable to sleep in. And we were right… the mattress was amazing, and the linens were top-of-the-line. I don’t think we’ve ever slept in such a comfortable hotel bed, and we’ve stayed at a lot of high-end hotels! In fact, if there’s any complaint to give this hotel, it’s that you won’t want to get out of bed to explore the city! 😊 Funny thing is, we stayed here as our Plan B hotel… we have a favorite Hilton brand hotel in Chicago, but it was booked on this last-minute trip, so we were happy to give LondonHouse Chicago a try. And are we ever glad we did! It’s a beautiful hotel with friendly staff, and when we walked into our room and saw two big screen TVs with an incredible view, we were thrilled. But when we sunk into bed that night, we knew we had found a new go-to hotel in Chicago. Oh, and can we just talk about the location… at the intersection of Wacker & Michigan overlooking the river, could it really be any better?!

Located within a historic building overlooking the re-imagined Chicago River and its noteworthy river walk extending all the way to Lake Michigan, this is a hotel of superlatives.  The newly expanded outside roof bar has eye-popping views of the Chicago River, famous architecture such as Tribune Tower and the Wrigley Building, even the lake.  Not to be missed.  Because the all-new rooms were made part of a 90 year building, expect that sizes and views will vary.  This review refers to the deluxe river front rooms.  Many creature comforts await in the high-quality rooms, including gorgeous carpeting, comfortable beds with pillows selection, enormous 50 inch television, individual room-lighting controls, and mini fridge.  The massive bright bath even has its own large window, with electrically operated shade for the modest.  Even a classy radio with excellent sound doubles as a clock and USB outlet.  Although the solid doors tend to close everywhere with a decided bang, the rooms in general have excellent soundproofing.  A  Nespresso machine with different coffee pods adds to the amenities.  Surprisingly, little storage space was included in the gut rehab.  The reason why the property did not earn five stars this year results from management neglecting to inform the front desk or anyone that the purpose of the visit was to celebrate a special event.  On a successful discussion with front desk agent Tori, who merits appreciation, resulted in confirmation into a river-facing room without the additional cost otherwise applicable.",5.0,,4.0,,,5.0,August 2018,Traveled as a couple,139,168.0

Another oddity is that there is no service elevator so we rode with pushy bellman with huge carts of luggage and folks with rolling carts of room service food.  Typically if the elevator is full the bellman won't try to squeeze in but not here.  The elevators are also a bit weird.  You have to have punch in your destination on a keypad and they tell you which elevator to get in.  Make a mistake and you're going for a ride as there are no buttons on the inside of the elevator.

It is definitely on the pricey side for hotels in Chicago but the location could not be beat - it is right on the river and in the middle of everything. The hotel is super swanky and recently updated so the rooms make you feel like a boss. There is a restaurant upstairs that is super well designed and has a really cosmopolitan feel. There is a bar on the roof that has amazing views and is such an awesome place to hangout for an afternoon drink or stop through for lounging at night. A lot of people come from other places in the city to go to this rooftop but guests don't have to wait in the line that forms at the elevators downstairs. Pay a little extra for a river view room - it is so worth it!,,,5.0,5.0,,5.0,July 2018,Traveled as a couple,62,31.0

I was assigned room 550.Check-in was quick and easy.  I arrived at approximately 10:00 AM and my room was ready.  What a pleasant surprise!  Jalesa checked me in. She was such a happy, friendly person.  Great customer service!A few minutes after I arrived in my room I received a personalized text message from Jalesa making sure everything was ok.  What a great personal touch.I also interacted with Shannon, one of the concierge.  She was very helpful, patient, pleasant, and knowledgeable!The room - it was HUGE and I had a nice side view of the Chicago River.  Now, it is important to note that when I checked out, I commented that the room was HUGE and the front desk agent was surprised.  So, I do not think all of the rooms are the same size.  I loved the size of the room.  It was clean, nicely appointed, and the AC worked perfectly.  However, there are two things I would change - there is no light over the desk, so the room is actually quite dark and if you want to work at the desk, the lighting is not adequate.   The bathroom was also very large.  However, I prefer a removable or adjustable shower head.  This was just a stationery shower head, so the water pressure was not the best.I had breakfast at Land & Lake Kitchen.  HiltonHonors Gold and Diamond members receive a $12 voucher to use at the restaurant for breakfast.  Breakfast was fine and service was ok.  Neither the taste of the food or service stood out to me.They have a rooftop bar and lounge on the 21st floor.  It seems to be VERY popular, as there was always a long line waiting for the elevator.I checked my bag with the bellman so I could explore for the day. Upon arrival to retrieve my bag, it was somewhat chaotic.  Multiple people were waiting a very long time for their bags.  However, I personally did not have to wait too long.  I did overhear the bellmen say that the bags are on the 6th floor, so it takes a substantial amount of time for them to go up, get the bags, and bring them back down.The location is PERFECT.  A great spot to explore Chicago and an easy quick walk from the nearest subway/metro station. Five stars for location,Zonnie checked me out.  She was just as happy and friendly as all of the other staff I interacted with.  Five stars for customer service.Overall this is a great property.

My family planned a last minute trip on Labor Day weekend and this was the only hotel that still had rooms available that met all our needs...particularly, has suites, kitchenette, central location, river view. The online booking experience was challenging because hotels were booking up quickly. The following day I called and requested a high floor, river view room. The staff assigned me a specific floor, notified me of the upgrade fee and I confirmed my change. Our 4.5 hour drive from St Louis took 7+ hours because of traffic. Needless to say my toddler was a mess by arrival. As we were checking in I asked the staff member to confirm the requested room type. I was then told that there was no record of my request and that the hotel was sold out so they couldn’t make any changes. What ensued was an almost 1 hour process to rectify their mistake. I was asked no less than 4 times (3 by the same person) who I spoke with at the hotel, and NOT ONCE did the staff apologize for the inconvenience (which was huge given my clearly exhausted and frustrated toddler...and the rest of my family). Eventually...after saying multiple times that they were sold out and there was nothing they could do and me standing my ground saying that was unacceptable...the manager miraculously found an available room with a river view. He then tried to charge me a higher upgrade fee, which I refused to do. Again...not once were the words sorry/apologize ever used. Furthermore, the staff made us feel like we were unwelcome and an inconvenience/annoyance to them. Unacceptable no matter how much we were paying but worsened by the fact that this was one of the more expensive hotels, plus the cost of parking our car with them for the entire trip. After that we tried to make the most of our short trip. The room was very comfortable and the view of the river was wonderful! My toddler loved looking at the boats go by. As noted above, the location is perfect. The hop on/hop off buses have a stop right outside the hotel. We easily walked up Michigan Ave all the way to 360 and back. On the last day we got breakfast from Corner Bakery Cafe in the Lobby, which was delicious, affordable and convenient. 5 stars for the hotel, 1 star for the service.",,,,,,,September 2017,Traveled with family,45,7.0

As a diamond member, I was upgraded to a river view, which was way better than the view from the rooftop bar! As a guest at the hotel, you can skip the crazy elevator line to the rooftop, but we were less than impressed once we got up there. It was insanely crowded, impossible to get a drink, and when we finally had a chance to look at the menu, we laughed and left. Even for Chicago standards, the prices were insane. We went to the Gold Coast and spent half as much per drink if that gives you any idea. The room was nice, bathroom was large with great amenities. The bed was super comfortable with really nice sheets, lots of fluffy pillows, and a down comforter. From someone who travels way more than I would like for work, and stays at a lot of hotels, I would say these sheets are probably the most luxurious I have had at a hotel in years!

I looked out the window and could only see the interior courtyard. Perhaps the desk clerks need to spend some time actually on the floors. So, zero view - bu the trade off was reduced street noise. If that was a diamond upgrade it was a fail. so, I'll assume it was a ""no upgrade.""The bathroom had decent space - two people could get ready at the same time. There was a small but workable desk.There were plenty of power outlets at the desk and bedside. Nice.The A/C was excellent. The property is in an area with a weak Verizon signal.

We stayed in a Vista King room, which had a stunning view of the Chicago River. My one complaint about the room is the bathroom door, which is a heavy frosted glass sliding door (think a barn door, only almost see-through). Several times I needed to have my husband assist me with opening the door because it would get stuck, and I didn't like the lack of privacy at all. Especially in such a small room. Tip: Even on the higher floors, the street noise is pretty noticeable, so we turned the fan on so that it masked some of the traffic sounds. The first night we went up to the rooftop bar because I'd heard great things about it. One of the benefits of staying at the hotel is that you receive priority access to the rooftop bar, which is apparently the hot place to be right now. I recommend making a reservation if you'd like to actually get a seat on the rooftop, which we did, however, we did encounter a staff issue there.We checked in about 15 minutes early. Unfortunately, the guy who checked us in disappeared by the time we returned when our table was ready, and the new gentleman at the reservation stand didn't believe me when I said that I'd made a reservation. Mind you, we'd literally just spoken with someone who checked us in and I saw our name on the list. ""I made this reservation via email about two weeks ago"" I told him. He replied (not kidding): ""Well, that's not possible because we've been booked for a month."" I had to root through my emails to prove to him that we did, in fact, receive a confirmation (even though I'd just seen it 15 minutes prior.) As it turns out, the first guy who checked us in marked us as a ""no show"" for some reason.  Perhaps as a concession, they gave us seats on one of the reserved couches, but we were told we could only stay there for an hour because another reservation was coming. During that hour, we were visited by the waitress maybe twice.  The rooftop certainly has an amazing view around sunset and the drinks were nice, but the service left much to be desired. You can tell it's definitely a hot spot around town because of the crowd.Overall, nice hotel and nice amenities, but it felt like it was always packed.",,,4.0,4.0,5.0,,July 2018,Traveled as a couple,55,67.0

Very professional and courteous staff and the location is in the heart of down town, with excellent views available. The not overly spacious rooms still feel luxurious with the posh amenities and decor. We had lunch/brunch at the Rooftop Restaurant, which has amazing views and the food is excellent. Somewhat limited menu with less than generous portions but the view and ambience more than make up for those and are worth the price.   Elevators are unusual in that prior to boarding, you select your desired floor and it tells you which elevator to board. No buttons in the elevator so a little confusing at first.

ON THEIR WEDDING NIGHT. They're at their reception so of course the last thing they are thinking about is calling to say they would be late. The desk worker was completely unsympathetic, even though they were standing in front of him in a tux and wedding dress, past midnight and exhausted. He refused to give them a refund. Instead he sent them to a less nice hotel and gave them $15 for a taxi, which was not even enough to cover the fare.I called the hotel today to complain. I give 3-4 stars to one of their staff who said she would send them a voucher for a free night's stay at a Hilton hotel. That is the least they can do for ruining their wedding night. I would give her 5 stars if she had gone above and beyond. I asked her for 2 nights but she said they couldn't b/c they had already covered Saturday night (at the less nice hotel...). She said that it wasn't marked in their reservation as their wedding night. But regardless! You are in the HOSPITALITY business. You can at least show some sympathy and human kindness to a young couple in the moment on their wedding night, even if you can't do anything in that moment. And that desk worker could have done something.  If I was able to get a voucher for them just by calling to complain, that desk worker could have gotten something for them. He could have said, ""I'm really sorry this happened. We know it's not as nice as London House but we'll cover your hotel and cab fare tonight and give you a free voucher for another night.""

Steps from all the major attractions in Chicago. The reason I am giving 4 stars is that I had to change rooms 3 times following my check-in. First room I got was facing a brick wall. Literally NO VIEW. It was about 1 meter from my window. I go to the front desk to ask for something a little more decent. I got to the second rooms and the curtains were broken and one was on the floor (i'm wondering how the cleaning lady didn't notice that?). Third time's a charm, I ended up getting a room on a lower floor but at least I wasn't facing a brick wall! I usually don't complain since I don't spend a lot of time in my room but having some sun is important for me. (avoid room 1632 or 1642!)Other than that, the hotel is great. I ate at the bistro close to the lobby with an amazing view on the river and went upstairs at the bar for drinks after a basketball game.

We had a reservation at the rooftop bar for 6pm on a Friday night, and were greeted at the hostess stand like we stole something. They didn’t have the reservation and treated us like we were 19 trying to sneak into a 21 bar. Once I got the manager to help us, we were seated. Then no one came to serve our table until I got up and asked them to come over. Once we had a server, they were great to us.The next morning it happened again. We went to the rooftop for brunch, and again waited for service. When they finally came, service was good.Major issue though...THEY DONT SERVE COFFEE AT BRUNCH. Unbelievable.Food was fine, but by then they had lost us.Their issue seems to be that they believe because they have a rooftop bar downtown, that supersedes service. It doesn’t.

The room had the most comfortable beds and the bathroom was extremely open and bright. In the morning breakfast was served and I ate while I took in the view of the Chicago river flowing into the lake. For a hotel in the middle of downtown that has to be the best view I’ve ever had.

Very similar experience on check out too... no attempt to engage in anyway. The only members of staff who smiled or made any attempt to engage were the luggage guys who were lovely.

From the greeting by the bellman at the door ( I cannot recall his name sorry) to Shannon the Concierge this is a great place and wonderful addition to the Curio collection.  We had another great view of the city and the river and loved the bar located on the rooftop.  Our room was great with a really neat tv/mirror panel that rotated depending on what and where you wanted to be to watch tv, not that we did, as there is too much to do along the River walk area.  Only thing I did not like was the amenities are foreign made, whereas the other hotels we stayed the amenities were made in USA. The bathroom though, was very cool with a very nice modern shower.

Thank you, Trevor. The room was spectacular, despite the side street ""building canyon"" view (still interesting for Chicago first-timers!).

The first one was not good and got 1 circle because of the interaction  I had with the assistant manager who was on duty during our check in Saturday. Although he used very poor judgement in how he dealt with the situation the front dest clerk Andrew did what he could as far as being pleasant and seeing how are stay was going. The manager Keith left his card under my door because of the ""do not disturb"" sign on my door, but was able to make contact with me today but I had already checked out. He listened and understood why I was upset, he did not attempt to downplay the situation nor make excuses for the assistant manager. He was very kind and I truly felt that he was sincere, he offered a couple of options to rectify the situation and made me feel as if he cared about my feelings. Whoever hired him did a wonderful job and I feel comfortable that once he speaks to his assistant manager he will handle future situations in a more professional manner.   One person does not represent a company as a whole but a negative interaction with one can lead to bad reviews that can affect potential customers from doing business with them. Now the hotel was beautiful and they cover little things that most don't in your room like a loofah sponge, toothbrush and toothpaste. The elevator system can confuse you at first but then it's  different and saves time even with 6. The bed and pillows are very comfortable and the view was nice. The staff was friendly but the valet parking when you arrive is a little confusing, just pull all the way up and you will be ok. The rooftop deck had nice views but I can't speak on food or drinks because I didn't eat or drink there because I was angry. There were several dishes on the menu that I wanted to try as well as the spa, but I didn't because of that first negative impression. Normally I never stay in the same hotel twice in Chicago because I want to experience each one, but after my conversation with Keith I will give them another try when I return. I truly appreciate the time Keith took to address the situation and wish there were more people like him in those kind of positions, because I believe very few hotels would get bad reviews if management knew how to not only talk to but listen to customers.",,,,,,,May 2018,Traveled with family,84,14.0

I loved everything about it except for the poorly designed room and bath. First, the bed's base extends beyond the mattress, and I have sore toes from all the stubs. The lighting is fine for Millennials who know how to fiddle with complicated operating pads. What happened to simple switches? One needs an operating manual to turn the lights on and off.  The fixtures in the bathroom are cheap. Nobs fall off in the shower, and the TP holder falls apart due to its open/close design. The sink stopper is difficult to reach and operate. Little stuff, I realize but it all can add up to comfort & functionality. The decor is modern for modern's sake - poorly coordinated, uninviting and lacking any real theme - just clunky looking.",,,4.0,2.0,,4.0,May 2018,Traveled on business,83,77.0

If you are a Gold/Platinum member of Hilton Honors, you do get a breakfast voucher for the restaurant on the main level.  I read some reviews that were disappointed with this, but it was fine.

The folks at LondonHouse couldn’t have been nicer. We were in a Vista room, that had floor to ceiling windows and a lovely view of the river. The location was perfect for doing some things around town, as it was a short walk to things like Millenium Park, Navy Pier, and is right on the Riverwalk. There is a nice open air bar on the roof, that was just opened recently for the season. The view up there is spectacular. Of course, you’re paying extra for the drinks at LH21, but you are paying for the birds eye vista on the city.When there was a hiccup during our stay, (the battery in the door lock died and we couldn’t get back into the room), the folks at the front desk offered a credit for some drinks in the lobby bar while security fixed the lock. Tip: If you are a Hilton Honors Gold or Diamond member, you can pick a free breakfast or 1000 points. The breakfast is a little more spartan than usual, so you might be better taking the points. The breakfast is basically coffee and either granola, fruit, or oatmeal. You can get scrambled eggs and bacon, but they charge you extra for that option. I expected something like the breakfast buffet you get at a Doubletree or other Hilton properties. Nothing wrong with the food or service, the food in the restaurant is good, and between 4-7 there was a nice happy hour there. Just thought the continental breakfast wasn’t worth as much as the 1000 honors points would be.In the lobby bar, on Saturday night, there was a guitar player, Joey Edwin, laying down some really nice jazz. Great way to relax before going out to dinner.",,,,,,,April 2018,Traveled as a couple,145,49.0

I’ve stayed in a lot of beautiful, well appointed hotels and LondonHouse is certainly another one. The building, reception, lobby bar, and room are beautiful. The room in particular is warm, comfortable, and upscale. The bathroom products are Malin + Goetz which I was very excited to see. My room was shower only, so if that’s important to you, you may want to make a special request. Subjectively, I will say that the reception staff is not what I expected. The woman that checked me in was cold. I booked through the Hilton app and wanted to use the digital key but without asking I was handed me a physical key. She was pleasant enough, but I felt like an inconvenience rather than a welcomed guest. This was definitely a transactional experience. The guy at check-out was much friendlier, but took a while to sort out that I wasn’t the guest he found in the computer when I gave my room number and name. I felt like I had to convince him he found the wrong guest. Eventually he said he found my reservation and that “everything is ok” but I walked away suspicious based on how he handled it. I received my folio and saw the stay post on the app so I guess it worked out. I hope the other guest doesn’t have as much trouble.

So for a 1400 dollar tab, they ran a little under 5,000 dollars totalSo I tried calling the club and left voicemails and nobody responded.  I called their bookkeeping office and left messages...no response.  So I started calling the GM Juan Leyva of the hotel, for three weeks.  No response.They left me no other option but to dispute the charges.  The bar there is fine, decent view outside.

The heritage features of the building are a treat, the rooms are spacious and the views from the rooftop deck are stunning. The service from the front desk was appalling!!! The whole experience from check-in to check-out and post-stay was an absolute fiasco.Upon checking out of the hotel I was told by the front desk THAT I HADN’T STAYED THERE - a remarkable statement to make to a customer who’s handing in their room key after three days in a hotel. I was told that there was no record of my reservation, my stay, my payment or the credit card I’d swiped on arrival. I was subsequently CHARGED TWICE for the same stay – an outrageous error for any hotel which is all the more infuriating since I was refused a copy of my bill when checking-out. I’m a regular traveller and without doubt this is the worst experience of service I’ve ever had in a business hotel – a complete catalogue of errors and a total disaster from start to finish. The receptionist and her senior colleague responsible for check-out were rude, disrespectful and at no point demonstrated any care or empathy to me as the customer. Communication after my stay has been woefully inadequate and I only had a response at all when I threatened legal action. At no point have I had an apology or even an explanation as to why this situation occurred in the first place. The experience of having been told to my face that I hadn’t stayed in the hotel is simply ludicrous.  I understand that mistakes are made from time to time, but it’s clear that the hotel has no regard for its customers at all.  It’s now 7 weeks later and my queries have still not been addressed. Perhaps this TripAdvisor review will miraculously generate a flurry of activity from the hotel’s management, but up to this point they couldn’t care less if they tried.

Hard to beat being on Whacker at Michigan Avenue ...right on the River when in the Windy City!The 'line up' of valets when you enter the VERY small lobby corridor (4 on the left, 3 on the right along the wall) made a very uneasy welcome.  Wow...The lobby is a quick ride upstairs.  Beautiful, but again...fairly small for a hotel this size.  The furnishings and decor are magnificent.The restoration of this building is superb.  Love the original elements that were left in place such as elevator trims, ceiling tiles, ornate grills, etc.  The mix of old with new technologies is amazing.Rooms are some the of the most beautiful in the city.  I love the decor.  Rooms are clean, comfortable and wonderful.  I had a beautiful view of the river and Chicago skyline during both of my stays here.  I could have done without the glaring TRUMP letters across the river that illuminated my room each night, but thats not the hotels fault! :)As a Gold member, i was given a voucher for breakfast at Land and Lake.  I have to say, that this restaurant (ground level) is probably the WORST excuse for a benefit I have ever experienced in a Hilton Hotel.  HORRIBLE is the only way to describe it.  Value of 'voucher' is awful.  Food quality and service were pathetic on both of my stays.  I would avoid this restaurant completely, as there are so many GOOD quality breakfast locations in close proximity...and the value of your coupon is basically worthless beyond a cup of coffee and a donut.  My impression of Land and Lake has made me assume that other food and beverage outlets within the hotel are no better, so i did not try the others on either of my recent two trips.Great looking hotel.

The worst of rooms has to do with the view from one window absolutely filled with Trump's name on the building. It also has to do with the room being too close to the elevators for this light sleeper.The other issue with the hotel is the elevator situation. The front desk folks did not tell me so it was even more frustrating but you have to key in your floor number on a digital pad and it tells you which elevator will take you there. No buttons in the elevators. It was frustrating as you can't change your mind if you pushed the wrong floor once you're in. Everyone I spoke to in the elevators thought it was a pain. BUT everything else was so fab. The service...so friendly and helpful. The roof top bar (not open yet due to weather but we could go out and see the view) crazy cool. You are in the perfect location to go to the A.I., to the park, shopping and theaters...the middle of it all.

It is one of my all-time favorite hotels, not just in Chicago, but in general. Whenever my travels take me to Chicago, I make it a point to stay here. Prior to my most recent visit in February, I became a Gold Member with Hilton, which gives you some perks like free upgrades, premium wi-fi, and your choice of free breakfast or bonus points, I chose the bonus points. I was also asked if I wanted to be upgraded to a King Studio with a river view or a 1-bedroom suite without a view. I chose the King Studio (2033) with a view of the river. It was tucked away in its own little corner which made it extremely quiet and allowed for some great sleep even though the restaurant and lounge are just one floor above.I've stayed in various room types at the LondonHouse, and even the standard rooms are excellent and in pristine condition. Rooms are always spotlessly clean and I very much appreciate the upgraded bath products they provide. They even include a small luffa which is awesome to have to take with you when traveling on the road. I love the public spaces such as the lobby bar area where I can bring my work and enjoy tea service. And in the evening, I like to go to the top floor bar for a drink. I always have a LH Martini complete with blue cheese stuffed olives. Make sure to check out the views from the roof. In the summer, you can sit outside and enjoy the view, which is always fun, but it's usually very busy. It'd be nice if they could have a small section reserved just for guests and another for the public. The service here is top notch! All of the staff I've ever encountered has been nothing but warm and welcoming. Whenever I visit, they go above and beyond their call of duty and they make you feel special rather then just being another guest. I especially appreciate this high level of service that I consistently receive every time I stay there. That's what keeps me coming back. The girl that checked me out this last time (I wish I had her name), recognized me from my last visit over NYE, and was especially accommodating after a small hiccup happened with housekeeping, that she did not let detract from my stay. She was shorter, with brown hair, and a beautiful smile and deserves to be recognized. Keep it up LondonHouse!!!

He then grabs the bags and escorts my wife and I to the lobby. We were greeted by a professional staff who catered to our every needs. The lobby was beautifully designed. We then preceded to the elevator where we punched in our floor on the key pad outside of the elevator. As we entered our suite I was blown away, the suite was beautiful with a river view of the city it was magical. We then began to unpack and relax. The beds were so comfortable and the two large televisions, one in the lounge and the other in the bedroom, I was in heaven, then we ordered room service. The food arrived in a timely manner and the waitress brought our food up and she was very polite and professional. The food was very flavorful and delicious I am very impressed. We woke up the next morning refreshed and ready to venture out to see what Chicago has to offer. We went to the rooftop restaurant for brunch another amazing restaurant, with a beautiful fire place and the furniture was very comfortable, I love this place. The food did not disappoint, after having brunch we went upstairs to the outside deck of the restaurant for a view of the city skyline, what a beautiful view, the weather was sunny and windy. This establishment is centrally located in the middle of everything, went many places and no place we went was over two mile Millennium Park, CIBC Theatre, Chicago Sky Deck and so on everything was within minutes away while using Uber. When we return to our suite there were a dish of chocolate covered strawberries with a congratulations letter on the table from Shannon, Jose and Anthony from LondonHouse Concierge. You all are Amazingly  Awesome.

You couldn't ask for a warmer and more gracious welcome. She was quick and efficient but made me feel like the most important person to them.

They did their best to be non intrusive, extremely friendly, kept me updated, apologized with sincerity for the issues. The light was fixed asap, the heating unit had some gremlins. The bad news was it took multiple attempts to get it going. The good news is the I got to see Nelson and Eric again! These guys deserve huge recognition. Just the friendliest and most professional representatives of the hotel! Give them big raises!The rest of the stay was wonderful. Amazing breakfast in the restaurant, spectacular views from the best rooftop terrace in Chicago, and consistently friendly and outgoing staff. They more than made up for any hiccups during the stay.

It is where Loop meets the start of Michigan Ave. Perfect location for those coming into Chicago and have the ability to walk to State Street or Michigan Ave to Shop. I would have given the hotel 5 stars only for the fact the standard rooms and even some of the upgraded rooms only have showers and no bathtubs. For families with small children a tub makes a huge difference.  The bathroom amenities are absolutely one the money for an upscale hotel. They not only provide you with a shower cap but for the ladies with long hair a hair tie. There is also a body scrubbing puff for your use also. The closet houses two Terry cloth robes with house slippers with plenty of space to hang your clothing and a nice safe. It is a great hotel for people to come and stay and in the summer the Roof Top Bar is a happening place to hang out and be seen.

However, LondonHouse was able to create an hotel with actual class.First off, it's in a great location, near the loop and millennium park. Check in was a breeze, and the the staff is extremely nice. Not in that New England or West Coast polite sort of way, but they all genuinely seemed to be happy to be at work and wanting to help you. We had brunch in the cafe near the lobby on the second floor, The staff was knowledgeable and excitable about the menu, very attentive,  and the food wasn't bad either.The room itself was well designed. It had some cool ""high tech"" features such as streaming video from your phone to the TV. TBH we didn't use it, but I appreciate the innovation. The toiletries brand they use is Malin + Goetz, and if you know the brand you can appreciate about half of what I paid for the room was instantly worth it in the travel sized shampoo, conditioner, bar soap, body gel, and moisturizer they give you, very nice! Espresso machine, but no coffee machine, I didn't really mind. Bathroom was spacious and had a nice shower head. We didn't get a room with a view, but it had ample lighting none the less.We didn't get a chance to check out the rooftop bar because it was too cold, but I bet it is nice.We didn't use the spa or anything because it was a sort trip.While the second floor bar prices are not cheap, I wouldn't say they are overpriced. You are paying a modest premium, and they deliver. Some of the roomservice breakfast items were a bit ridiculously priced though. Really, the only complain I have is I wasn't a fan of the fogged glass sliding bathroom door and how you could hear the bathroom from the entire room. I'll leave it up to your imagination what problems that might cause, lets just say I prefer both visual and auditory privacy from the bathroom. When I come back to Chicago in the summer I will strongly consider staying here again! Highly recommended.",4.0,,5.0,,5.0,,February 2018,Traveled as a couple,1,1.0

It's ultra modern and chic with every comfort you could ask for. I've been told the rooms are smaller than those in Trump Tower, but I thought the size was comfortable and the modern amenities exceeded my expectations. The only issue I had was that the glass sliding door to the bathroom didn't stay closed, but perhaps that was human error.The meeting room accommodations where wonderful. Very spacious with nice views of the city - which is a plus when you're in meetings all day. What impressed me the most was the selection of food for breakfast, lunch and mid-meal snacks. We had a group of about 100 and it was the best conference food I've ever had because it wasn't the usual boring rubber chicken. At breakfast we had unique, healthy items like beef bone broth and green tea smoothies, along with more traditional fare like pancakes, oatmeal with toppings, scrambled eggs and sausage links, breakfast burritos, fresh fruit, etc. At one lunch we had a choice of 4 different fresh lettuces (iceberg, arugula, spring mix, spinach) and three proteins (chicken, beef with chimichurri, grilled salmon) with other sides. Another day we had a wonderful grilled fish, shrimp risotto and grilled chicken with a wedge Greek salad and other sides. Desserts were a variety of bite-size items like cheesecake, cupcakes, cookies. Snacks included a Mediterranean Bar with baba ganoush, hummus, pita chips and veggies and another day fresh baked pretzels with cheese dip. Yum! Enough about the food, already! (FYI: The boxed lunch on our last day was also great.) The hotel has nice bars on site, which is great for gathering socially during the winter when you may not feel like venturing outdoors. And they are nice venues where locals go there too - ran into a few friends. The second floor bar is open, bright and offers a few different seating areas and live entertainment. The 21st floor bar is darker, classy, upscale with comfy seating and entrance to the fabulous patio (a must-see even in the winter.)During my stay, the concierge texted my cell phone a couple times a day. I thought it was OK, but some colleagues found that intrusive since they didn't ask for permission. By proactively texting me, I wish they would have been a little more helpful, like making the two-minute walk to 7-Eleven to get me contact solution rather than just giving me the address - which I can Google myself. Other than that, service was amazing and courteous.All in all, I enjoyed my stay very much and would love to return for a stay-cation.",,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,January 2018,Traveled on business,173,53.0

I had made a reservation a month in advance and was surprised that we were seated contrary to my requests (sofa by the edge). The host explained that the sofas had a high minimum spend, my southern accent must indicate poverty, and seated us to his lowered expectations. I'm not certain if he called the staff downstairs, or sensed an income opportunity, but he did move us to the desired location within twenty minutes and apologized for the misunderstanding.

Its surprising how noisy traffic from Wabash is even when you are up 17 floors! Though having lived near a major international airport once it didn't faze me but the wife had trouble getting to sleep. Rooms are modern, well decorated and functional except they could do without the fancy light controls etc. Or maybe I am just showing how dated I am.  The breakfast was so so, you're better off walking 2 blocks down State street to TheWit and getting breakfast in their coffee shop. As a Hilton Diamond member for many years I've experienced lots of Hilton properties and this was my first experience with the Curio  group. I had a billing issue when we left.  I usually skip the desk checkout and just leave and I get the bill emailed.  When it came the afternoon after we had departed I noticed they had tacked on a restaurant charge which wasn't ours. No big deal I thought. I called the front desk but it took 3 calls, multiple  back and forth between the front desk and restaurant and it was housekeeping (and how did I get transferred there??) who eventually got me to a person who could fix my problem! It was fixed quickly after that but seriously, the first front desk folks kept telling me first to speak with the restaurant and the restaurant manager (once you find a live person there in the afternoon) kept saying he can't do anything without seeing the hotel bill which he can't access. But why tell me that half a dozen times and not just say after the first one or two times that he will connect me to the people who can fix my issue. I've been in Hampton Inns in Nowhere where the staff are better trained. I know its not the Waldorf but like I said Hamptons can do better! Maybe its because the staff are new at this newer location.

In fact, if there's a 0/5, I might choose that option instead. For those of you that value services, my experience will give you a second thought on whether you want to choose to stay here — given there are plenty of decent hotels in Chicago. So here's what happened. I had to take a last-minute trip to Chicago for some family emergency, so I booked my hotel very last minute...just to have a place to stay and a place to work. Upon checking into the hotel, the staff gave me the room (#1642). I asked if the room has a good view, they informed me that if I wanted to upgrade to a better view, they can offer me a discounted rate. While having a good view might be nice, my purpose of the visit wasn't for leisure, so I turned it down. As I arrived at my room, I was ready to take a quick power nap but couldn't get the electronic curtains down. To be more specific, I had two windows in the room and one curtain worked fine while the other didn't. So I called guest services and asked them if they could send someone up to check. They said yes. Roughly 15 minutes later, I decided to call again just to see when they will send someone, the lady on the other side of the phone said she put in a request already but not sure when. So I asked her to check and let me know. Another 10 minutes later, I got no calls from her, so I decided to call her back. This time, I asked her if anyone's coming soon, and she said ""even if someone comes to your room, they can't fix it because they don't have the parts"". I was annoyed and a bit furious at the time and asked her why she didn't tell me during my first call because by then I wasted half an hour just sitting on the bed waiting. So I told her I'll just go downstairs to exchange for another room. When I went back down to the front desk and told them about the situation, they told me they'll get me another room. This time they gave me room #1742, exactly the same layout but one floor higher. As soon as they gave me the new keys, I went upstairs. For some reason, in the back of my mind, I had a feeling this room wouldn't have working curtains, either. And guess what....I was right! As soon as I gave the curtains a 5-min try, I went back down to the front desk and informed them the situation. They were...unapologetic and in disbelief that both rooms' curtains did not work for me. As I asked them to give me another room that actually works...one manager-looking person peaked over and said ""what's going on? Is it the room 42? don't give customers room 42!"" Can you imagine how I felt at that time? How could these people NOT communicate internally? It was obvious that room 42 had issues so how could they give me that room twice. While the guy at the front desk was trying to place a room for me, I asked him if they have been having issues with curtains since the lady from guest services told me they don't have the parts. Guess what he replied? He said ""nope, never heard of it"". Then I told him about how I just wanna make sure the next room works, so I wouldn't have to come downstairs again. Instead of being apologetic about the situation, he asked ""where's your luggage?"" I said, I have a backpack only. Then he replied ""oh, that's not that bad then"". SERIOUSLY, SERIOUSLY? Just because I don't have that much stuff, he considered me coming downstairs TWICE and wasting my time was not that much of an inconvenience? I wanted to ask for a manager at the time but by then I needed to get some work done, so I just went upstairs and hope for the best. This time, they gave me a room on a much lower floor with a manual curtain rather than the broken electronic type. Throughout this whole time, NO ONE from the staff (either over the phone or in person) demonstrated any quality of customer service that should have been offered at the level of this hotel chain. I am very very surprised and will never come back again. P/S Initially, I was going to book an SPA at the hotel but decided not to spend even one extra dime in this place. I have travelled and stayed in many places around the world, this is probably by far....one of the worst hotel stay experience I've had.",,,1.0,2.0,2.0,,January 2018,Traveled solo,109,110.0

Second, pillows aren't the best around so I had a less than ideal first night before I found a way to make the bed more comfortable.

However, 1833 and 1933 are. They are not in the corner of the hotel but based on the renovated layout those two rooms were designed as studio suites so they are considered as such although they are not in a corner. The other 31 corner studios on property are in a corner.""Our visit started off with the front desk staff _repeatedly_ trying to convince us that the room they originally put us in was a ""corner room"" (a room we'd prepaid a higher rate to get). See the picture-- clearly, 1733 is not a corner room, both because it wasn't in a corner (as the Merriam-Webster Dictionary or the rest of the world would define it) but also because it didn't match the hotel's description of a corner room having a separate sitting area.  Eventually, they put us in a corner room- which was PERFECT- but not before making us feel as if we were difficult customers.Once we got into the right room, we loved it. We had a great view of the river and the lake, the bed was so comfortable and the layout of the room made it feel roomy and cozy at the same time. The location is really awesome as well.We tried the bar.  It was Jan so although the rooftop bar wasn't open, you could go out to see the view, which was spectacular.  In the bar, however, I would say that staff were decent bartenders but not mixologists-- there are better bars in Chicago nearby.I'd stay here again -especially if I knew I'd end up in room 1635 (or similar corner room)-- it was a great room for a getaway weekend.",4.0,,2.0,5.0,,,January 2018,Traveled as a couple,68,48.0

I have stayed here three times. Once by myself and the other two times were with my mother and sister. The hotel opened in 2016 and EVERYTHING still looks brand new!!!! I have stayed in the standard rooms before and this time I stayed in the presidential suite!!!! It left me speechless!!! It was the nicest hotel room I've ever stayed in!!!! Both the standard rooms of my past stays and the presidential suite were magnificent. The rooms are spacious, they feature very new, modern finishes. A wonderful spa-like bathroom and grand shower fit for a king or queen. The room was simply outstanding and so was the customer service. All employees were very, very accommodating, friendly and I really felt welcome. The location is also excellent because you are right off the iconic Magnificent Mile. You are walking distance from great shops, restaurants, parks, museums, the Chicago River Walk, the Nutella store, the Chicago Tribune and Navy Pier. I have stayed at many hotels in downtown and London House is by far my absolute FAVORITE. I highly recommend this hotel if you are young or old, a single traveler or traveling with family. The hotel is very luxurious but affordable!!! I also liked that the hallways were very quiet and I couldn't hear any noise from the surrounding rooms. London House also offers a beautiful, roof top bar, a state-of-the-art fitness center, room service and the food they serve is delicious!! Lastly, I have nothing negative to say about my stay here. My mom, sister and I think this is the best hotel ever and we cannot wait to return!!!! Thank you London House for making us feel so special!!!! All hotels should aim to be like London House!",,,,,,,January 2018,Traveled solo,6,

We booked through the Hilton app and then requested an upgrade to a Vista room a few days later (also through the app- this is the best deal on an upgrade, only $15). The floor to ceiling windows were well worth the upgrade price. I loved the room, the view (as another reviewer mentioned. Choose a room that ends in 13). The bed was SO comfortable, and I’m incredibly picky about beds and pillows. The room was decorated so beautifully, the bathrooms gorgeous as well. The bellmen were friendly and helpful.  Also the soap had the best smell ever, I couldn’t stop smelling it, and I took it and the body wash home to finish using it. Classy and high quality all around.

This does require its own app aside from Google Home, but wi-fi is free, so you won't be eating your data to download it.-Rooftop bar with amazing views overlooking the Chicago River. If your room doesn't have a view, simply come up to the top floor and take a look around.-Little touches like a loofa, gooseneck reading lights, and bedding patterned in the hotel's monogram. Cons: -The front desk girl was pushy about getting us to pay for an upgrade. Would forgive her somewhat if she turns out to be partially paid on commission. -Getting to the registration desk is somewhat confusing. More prominent signage by the elevators or the foot of the stairs would be helpful. -Elevators take getting used to; there are no buttons inside the elevator (you select your destination floor from the call button in the hallway) so you can't change your mind about where you want to go once you get in. The building is a Chicago historical landmark, and a famous jazz club once resided in it. Though there do seem to be jazz references here and there, it might be nice for the hotel to build more explicitly around that theme. Or a British theme -- I came across a fellow guest from a Commonwealth country who seemed confused at LH's lack of British-ness.",5.0,,4.0,4.0,,,December 2017,Traveled with friends,22,8.0

There is a parking garage right around the corner they used (left parking garage ticket in my car) so if you just park there yourself you could save some money. Check out Spot Hero to check out reduced parking. Wish I would have done this before. Check In was easy and quick.

It was an easy Uber ride to the hotel from O'Hare during off-peak hours but the hotel is also close to multiple mass transit stops (L Train and bus) which makes it easy to get around. The doorman was very helpful in pointing me in the right direction at check-in as the hotel lobby is actually located on the 2nd floor of the building. Reception from the front desk was warm and welcoming. Check-in was smooth and painless and I was able to check in and go to my room quickly. I was given a corner room with a lovely view of the water that directly faced the Trump tower across the river. The room was well maintained and decor was modern and tasteful. Unfortunately the coffee machine did not work and the ice machine on my floor was broken which was a slight nuisance. In-room wifi did not work when I arrived in the room so I called the front desk who quickly helped resolve the issue. My main gripe was the inconsistent service. After checking in, I made my way to the lobby bar for a drink. At midnight, the bar closed and I was told by the bartenders that I could make my way up to the rooftop bar on the top floor of the hotel for a nightcap. After riding the elevator to the top floor I grabbed a seat at the bar where I sat ignored for 10 minutes until a bartender finally notified me that they were closed... It was my understanding that the top floor bar was open past midnight, given the conversation I had with the lobby bartenders but it seems they arbitrarily decided to close early on a slow night. Even if the bar was closed at a normal time, they should have made that clear instead of wasting my time. The bartenders were not rude but not very apologetic about the whole mix-up. Overall the rooms were what I expected and the location is wonderfully convenient given the proximity to downtown, the Magnificent Mile, and many of Chicago's main tourist attractions (Millennium Park, Grant Park, Riverwalk) but the inconsistent service and broken ice machine/coffee maker was a bit frustrating for a hotel of this price/caliber.",,5.0,3.0,,4.0,,December 2017,Traveled solo,7,1.0

First, the room was great.  We had a corner studio and it was spacious (and I'm picky about large hotel rooms), well decorated, very clean, and had large windows across two walls.  Just a beautiful room.  The bed and pillows were comfortable.  The towels were soft enough.  The temperature was great.  And the room had the expected amenities like a hair dryer and coffee-maker.  The TV also had the capability to use Chromecast and broadcast Netflix to the TV from our iPad.  Second, the location is fantastic.  The hotel is located right on the river at the corner of Wacker and Michigan avenue.  It's close to the theater district, but also close to shopping on Michigan avenue and State Street.  It's also close to Millennium Park.  Just a great central location in the loop.  It's close to great restaurants, too (but most hotels are in downtown Chicago).  Everyone in the hotel was very friendly, and there's also a rooftop bar with great views of the city.  Valet parking was $71 overnight and that's pretty steep, so be warned if you choose to park down there.  We expected expensive parking so that's not my one complaint.  My one complaint is the bathroom door.  Why do some hotels have a glass bathroom door?!?  It's a bathroom.  People want privacy.  Ugh.  I thought the room was beautiful but was immediately disappointed upon seeing the sliding glass door for the bathroom.  And, yes, it doesn't lock or close 100% (so there is a 1 inch crack that you can see through).  And, yes, it is easy to hear everything the person is doing in the bathroom through that door.  I don't know if this matters to most people, but it matters to me and it would prevent me from staying at this hotel again (if I had to share the room with someone else).  I thought so much was great about the hotel, but, for me, the bathroom door is a deal-breaker.",,,5.0,4.0,,5.0,December 2017,Traveled as a couple,309,141.0

A little different take on a staycation that’s almost as relaxing as getting out of town. Maybe more since it takes so much less time to walk a couple of blocks and be at your destination!!! Anyway, we really enjoyed the London House this weekend. We chose a Vista suite which gave us a lovely view of the river toward the west and if we craned our heads up against the window, we could get a glimpse of Michigan Avenue and the Wrigley building. It was a pretty blustery weekend with snow but we still had a great time enjoying the hotel and environs. We hit the LH on 21 lounge at exactly the right moment to get one of the cozy nooks with wee sofas and fluffy pillows. It was a great place to unwind after a really crazy week and we spent two hours just enjoying the ambience and catching up. London House is perfectly placed to take advantage of so much of what Chicago has to offer – all within easy walking distance. Just a few blocks south and slightly west is Macy’s State Street store and Block 37 and at this time of year, Chicago’s Christkindlmarket at Daley Plaza. To the south and slightly to the east along Michigan Avenue is Chicago’s famous Millennium Park with the Cloud Gate, Crown Fountain and two places to ice skate as well as the Art Institute. Just to the south west you’ll find many of Chicago’s theaters including the Chicago Theater and the Goodman, the Oriental and the Cadillac Palace. Cross the river to the north and slightly west and you will have a hard time choosing which of the fabulous River North restaurants to try. Cross the river on Michigan Avenue and you’ve entered the Magnificent Mile, full of wonderful shops. The River Walk is almost right outside the door and you can head straight east to enjoy Navy Pier. London House is one of the newer hotels in Chicago so everything is still just beautiful. Comfy beds with crisp white linens. A seating area with a comfy couch and big TV. A beautifully appointed bathroom with lots of gorgeous marble and granite. There’s even a small refrigerator that is wide open to hold those delicious left-overs from that restaurant you enjoyed so much and tastes almost as good for a late night snack. The one and only downside to our stay was that on Friday night, probably one of their busier times, the elevator system was really slow and very crowded. Our assigned elevators arrived stuffed to the walls with people so we had to wait for another that arrived similarly stuffed. But that’s really the only time we had issues with the elevator. We recommend London House and we will definitely be back to take advantage of LH on 21! And when the weather warms up, we will be enjoying the spectacular views from LH on 22.",,,,,,,December 2017,Traveled as a couple,1521,434.0

North to the shopping mecca of the Mag Mile, and Lincoln Park. South to Millenium and Grant parks, the waterfront, and the museums. I used to stay at the River Hotel next door (which is still a great value), but you can't beat the London House for location, quality and value. The only downsides are the arrival experience (if no one tells you the lobby is on the second floor, you'll wander the first floor for a minute or two), and the fact that the 10 degree windchill prevented visiting the rooftop bar.",,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,December 2017,Traveled solo,7,3.0

It was our second year in a row coming to Chicago for a weekend and we knew hands down we would be staying at LondonHouse again! We absolutely love this hotel!! The location is amazing and the river views from the hotel rooms can not be beat! Make sure you book a vista room, as this will get you the river views with floor to ceiling windows. The rooms are spacious and beautiful with very nice bathrooms as well. The concierge are friendly and will hold your luggage with no issues. Front desk staff was inviting and accommodating to our needs.  We have not taken advantage of the hotel breakfast or rooftop bar, so cannot comment on those aspects, but we saw many people coming into the hotel to go to the rooftop bar. Maybe next year we will check this out! Every time we come to Chicago we will definitely be staying at this hotel and would recommend it to everyone!",,,,,,,December 2017,Traveled with family,12,3.0

The rooms were discounted, and easy to get on Friday night, but now I know why. Pluses:Quiet room, curtains blocked light. Modern lighting controls throughout. Nice, higher-end furnishings & design, felt cozy. Tivoli radio, bedside plugs for charging, bedside sconce & mini reading lamp. Toto toilet, modern shower, Malin & Goetz toiletries. Minuses: No ground floor lobby - big mistake, no presence on street, no free room upgrade (they offered city view for half price of $30). Very compact Y-shaped room. Sheets scratchy, not enough pillows to lounge comfortably in bed, 1 small robe, not 2. Frustratingly slow Wifi, no new or current films on demand to watch, few channels (they suggest you stream your own via chrome cast). 1 hook total in bath, zero towel bars! No handshower, no bench, center drain (who wants to stand on shower drain?).  Had to leave voicemail for room service. Finally called back, but very small, unimpressive menu. We ordered 2 burgers, a salad, fries w/ aioli, 2 waters, 1 dessert, 1 tea. We got most of it, sans tea, aioli, silverware for 2nd person, and bill was $95! We called back, she brought pot of tea & silverware, but no mug or cup, or typical cream, sugar or honey? We caught it and asked before she left room, she made excuse ""we ordered so much"" but then she never came back!? Thankfully we used the tiny espresso cups for tea. The food was mediocre. I know Chicago & it's foodie scene, this was a ridiculous room service disaster. I think this hotel has potential to improve on many levels, but they need to start with management and staff training. It's in a historic building, centrally located, perfect for visitors. I hope it becomes the kind of hotel I would expect in this location, with the appropriate amenities and thoughtful service to match.",,,,,,,December 2017,Traveled as a couple,104,30.0

The lobby is bright and airy and a very comfortable place to sit around.We were greeted by a friendly registration desk - but it seemed to take longer than normal to check us in.  The room wasn’t ready even though it was after 4:00pm. We were told they would call when ready - of course an hour later I went to see about the room - which of course was ready, but they forgot to call.  This minor glitch is really the only negative of our stay.The room while not big, was very well appointed. Great TV, very comfy bed and pillows. The view of the Chicago River and the bustle of the Mag Mile.  For some folks, the Trump lovers, the Tower and its sign may be a bit overwhelming... for his supporters, it’s heaven.We got no street noise, or noise from the hallway.We did not go to the club on the top 3 floors... but it is obviously extremely popular based on the crowds waiting in line      to get in.The only things we would have liked to see was the ability to get breakfast within the hotel itself - not the unaffiliated establishment on the first floor.  There are plenty of choices nearby, but we would have preferred to stay in.Bottom line, we enjoyed our stay - the minor glitches had no negative impact on our stay and would come back again based on style, location, comfort and importantly, price.",,,,,,,December 2017,Traveled as a couple,85,144.0

The lobby/check-in is a bit confusing, as it's on the 2nd floor, but the area is beautiful with plenty of lounging/sitting space, a bar and contemporary artwork. The elevators were a bit foreign, but once we figured out the system, it was actually pretty efficient (enter floor number into a wall display and it directs the user to the appropriate/available elevator).

I was excited to try it out as I had heard great things but our experience fell very short.  I have stayed in over 10 hotels in Chicago and this was one of the worst experiences.  I requested early checkin for both rooms which cannot always be honored which I understand as I used to work in hotels.  We tried to check in at 10am and they weren't ready so we checked bags in and went about our day.  Come 4pm, one room was ready but the other wasn't. Then 5 pm and the second room still wasn't ready.  I have never experienced a room not being ready PAST checkin time.  Finally around 5:30pm they were both ready but we had dinner reservations at 6 and needed to change and were waiting for our bags when we got a call from the bell desk about the description of our bags.  Needless to say at this point we had no more time so I had to come down to the desk and look for myself as we had 8 people in our party and ALOT of bags.  Finally we got all the bags together and up to our room and had to rush to dinner.  They did send up wine and truffles to our room, but only one bottle for two rooms and 8 people.  We attempted to use the credit at the bar on the 21st floor but the service and drinks were significantly slacking.  Upon going to checkout I was told I had a balance as the credit was not added and my card had been charged.  I told the lady at the front desk that there was supposed to be credit on our rooms and she had to investigate to get it taken care of.All in all, the whole experience at the Londonhouse was far below expectations.

Most frequently, I am a Chicago traveler. I’m almost always up there for work but a friends wedding brought my husband and I up to Chicago for a rare occasion of fun. I knew I had wanted to stay at LondonHouse as friends and family had told us such great things... so let’s break it down! 1- Service: Quite a few things to remark about here... first, we received a complimentary upgrade to the vista suite which offered an amazing view as well as separate living and sleeping areas. This was a big win as my husband is an early riser and myself a night owl. The front desk personnel were amazing and the valet and concierge were too. We didn't have to lift a finger once we pulled up.  2- The Room: I mean beautiful and modern don’t begin to explain the rooms - they are amazing! Floor to ceiling windows with a view of the river and Downtown Chicago and one super comfy bed. One of our favorite things was the special features the room had including the motion sensing bathroom lights which slowly dim on. The other was the Chromecast capability with the TVs. For those that don't know, it allows you to stream pretty much an application to the TV from your phone like Netflix, Hulu, Etc. It was amazing and such a great way to watch movies and make the most of it. In fact we enjoyed both the lights and Chromecast so much we are literally putting both in our house!!! 3. Location: I usually stay in the loop, so River North was a bit of a jump for me (albeit it was very close!). After staying here, I'd never stay anywhere else location wise. Easy access to Michigan Avenue, The Magnificent Mile, hundreds of amazing restaurants, and of course a Starbucks on every corner ;) We were within a 1-2 mile walk of everywhere we wanted to go and it was such a great benefit. The location is worth the hotel price alone. Now to the nitty gritty, of course nothing is ever 100% perfect - but I do have to say LondonHouse was the closest any hotel I've stayed at has gotten to. So if I had recommendations for the hotel on what to consider it would be the following two items:A) The Nespresso: this was an amazing feature, but 3 espresso pods to 2 adults is a bit of a stretch and the maid did not refill these every morning, it was more of every other day. Either offering a larger selection and refilling daily or also offering a coffee maker would remedy this!B) The Hilton Honors Breakfast: There really isn't one... now the front desk was 100% transparent about this, but it was only after booking. I'm use to getting either a full continental breakfast or breakfast vouchers for an on site restaurant, which LH did not offer. It wasn't a deal breaker for us, but having to go explore for breakfast every day did put a hitch into our normal morning hotel routine!",5.0,5.0,5.0,,,,November 2017,Traveled as a couple,2,1.0

Very comfortable, with a good workspace and nice views, as well as some room to stretch out. This week, I had a Vista king, with full-length windows overlooking the river (and, sadly, looking straight at the Trump hotel across the river, but you can't have everything). The Vista rooms are a little snug, but still comfortable, and the view is remarkable. The staff is amazing. From the doormen to the front desk to the housekeeping staff, everyone acts like seeing you is the high point of their day.

Not the case with London House.  I called to double check the night before our departure and the front desk asked if I was Mr. Montgomery?  I said yes, they said that Robert was off but had called to make sure I was taken care of.  Unheard of.  Mind blown.  Walked in with my wife, 6 and 8 year olds and sure enough our room was waiting.

I'm a breakfast nut--I like my eggs, bacon, and anything else thrown in!  He suggested that I take the points in lieu of breakfast coupons, and avail myself of the Corner Bakery.  I'm glad I did; the Corner Bakery is an excellent alternative and in true Chicago style, they are quick in the mornings.

The hotel is barely two years old in a complete redo of a historic building.  From the doorman, the room attendants, the concierge to the manager everyone has a smile and impressive attitude.  The lobby is clean modern and with numerous elevators so no wait time to arrive in your room.  I originally picked a room near the end of the hall at the back of the building.  The front desk talked me into moving to a room I had looked at but didn't pick because it was near the elevator but had a view.  The room was smaller but the view was truly nice.  Only problem was I am a very light sleeper and the hum of the elevator kept we awake but for most people this would not be a problem. I was in room 1411.  The room was clean modern and not overly large but adequate size.  However the best part of the stay was when we realized the tie for the suit for the wedding was not packed.  Went to the concierge, Jose he tried to find one to loan in the back, no luck.  Talking with Alex the manager on at the time they then talked to the only desk person Abel wearing a tie if he would loan it for the evening. He said I have one in my car, ran to his parked car came up with a Brand New tie to loan my husband.  Amazing service that cannot be had at even the best hotels.  Truly an incredible staff!!!

It is only a 5-7 minutes walk to the shops and department stores on N. Michigan Avenue.  The entrance to a waterway trail for a jog or a relaxing stroll is just across the street.My reservation was upgraded to a suite but turned out the room had a claustrophobic view of surrounding tall buildings.  The front desk was able to arrange a Vista room instead upon request.  The exchanged room offered a welcoming contemporary feel with high ceiling and an unobstructed view of the waterway.  The small closet was okay for a single traveler's belongings but would be tight for a larger party.  The sliding closet doors required a bit of work to operate as they often get stuck on their tracks.   The retro design alarm clock was not lit which made it difficult to tell time when the lights were off.  The bed was comfortable nonetheless.The front desk was unclear on the Hilton Honors (HH) breakfast arrangement with the Land & Lake Restaurant on the ground floor.  The complimentary breakfast was skimpy with only juice and a pastry which made it the poorest HH breakfast selection made available among the many Hilton's I visited.  Guests have the option to receive a $10 credit toward their bill in lieu of the complimentary breakfast.  The cook-to-order breakfast from the menu was only so-so at best.  I recommend the Corner Bakery Cafe which is also located next to the hotel.One may consider riding Uber rather than paying $77 per night hotel parking if that suits your travel plan.  Uber X fare between O'Hare and LondonHouse costs roughly ~$37 one way or ~$80 round trip.It is hoped Hilton / LH management team can improve the breakfast situation for HH members.  That being said it was a pleasant stay at the LondonHouse.  I will be happy to return during my next visit to the windy city!A Helpful vote will be very much appreciated if you find my review informative.",4.0,,5.0,5.0,,,October 2017,Traveled on business,110,125.0

Restful, Clean and High Class!","I loved my experience at the LondonHouse.  I had selected this hotel because I was looking for upscale accommodations to celebrate a milestone in my life.  I was not disappointed in the least!  The staff was friendly and very helpful.  The room was spacious, nicely equipped with a refrigerator and two large size flat screens.  It was easy to come and go and access the room floors using the modern elevator sequence device.  You simply enter your floor number and the displays tells you which elevator to get on.  A great way to save time and energy (a green feature for sure!).I found my room to be spacious, comfortable and equipped with lots of seating.  I loved the feel of the upscale bathroom with walk-in shower stall.  You will be tempted to stay in the shower for an hour.  I found the overall flavor of the hotel to be styled for class and a young, vibrant clientele; however, it is one special place that everyone will enjoy.  The hallways leading away from the elevators are spacious and the floors nicely styled and clean.  Did I tell you how clean everything was.  The hallway carpets were clean from corner to corner, and I found my room to be nothing less than spotless. The price will vary from season to season, but it is definitely worth every penny due to the level of comfort one will receive to the likable convenience of its location.  The hotel is right on the Magnificent Mile, close to shopping, attractions, theaters and restaurants.  You can easily walk to the park or catch a train to other parts of the city.  Downtown Chicago is a great place to be, to explore, and to venture out for entertainment.  Like any city do be aware of your surroundings and enjoy.  Downtown Chicago has so much to offer.  Wrigley Field is a short train ride away.  Jump on and follow the crowd.  You'll all get there together.Hilton spared no expense in renovating this old business building into a first class hotel.  Pamper yourself and check in at the LondonHouse for a great, rememberable stay in Chicago.  I can't wait to return, and I will definitely patronize the LondonHouse again.  The location was perfect!!  I can't stress that enough.  You will be in the nicest part of town and centrally located between major attractions:  the Chicago Pier, the art museum, the Bean, the outdoor concert amphitheater, Wrigley Field, theaters, restaurants galore, and the list goes on.",,,5.0,5.0,,5.0,September 2017,Traveled solo,644,49.0

We had called and asked if we needed to book a table on the roof deck for a party of 8 friends meeting us, and were told, no worries, plenty of room.  Turns out, not true, and also no room in the inside bar.  The other main annoyance I had was that at the time of booking, they force you to choose an upgrade, that if available you will pay for.  I didn't particularly want an upgrade, I'm not in the room enough to care, but the website railroads you into it.  Additionally, an upgrade is generally something that I consider a perk for being either a regular customer, using a certain card, or just goodwill from the hotel.

Was the hotel nice? Yes.  Was the staff polite? Yes. But more than that, they have a serious problem with theft.  I immediately reported an item left in my room, within 45 minutes of my departure.  I boarded my plane and was told 2 hours later that someone had already checked in the room, which I find very strange that on such a busy weekend they could accomplish this so quickly. I spoke with guest services, head of security, and a manager receiving a different story about whether the room was occupied so quickly or not from each of them.  Mr. Cestare the manager ultimately informs me there is no way the purse could get out of the hotel by a staff member.  I beg to differ, there is absolutely no doubt that my purse did get out of the hotel by someone on their staff.  I have traveled all over the world personally and with the U.S. Dept of State, I have found items that I have turned in and I have accidentally forgotten items and they have always been returned to me until my stay at LondonHouse. Although, this review will not keep people from staying at this hotel, as a frequent traveler I feel it is my duty to worn everyone.  I have written hundreds of positive reviews and very very few negative ones.  This is one of the worst in my over 30 years of traveling personally and for the U.S. Government, mainly because they did absolutely nothing to make this right.

The views are also unbeatable especially from the Vista rooms.  However the design of the vista suite rooms is not very well thought out and seems back to front.  There is no double glazing in the outer window so one can hear street noise through the window.  And rather than the suite area being close to the window, the suite area is dark and windowless while the bed is closer to the window.  Thus the sofa and suite area through an internal door feels more like a corridor to the bathroom.  It would make more sense to have it the other way round with the bed closer to the bathroom for convenience but also where it would benefit from a further barrier door and window from the street noise.They also do not have a restaurant or any meaningful breakfast option and the hotel's skyline bar at the top is packed with little room for seating and is not really designed as a space for resident hotel guests to relax and enjoy having paid the premium for a nightly stay.  Instead anyone can take the elevator up from the street.  So it's crowded and no place for hotel guests to take advantage of the venue.

We found $35 a night. You go to 2nd floor to check in and received a glass of champagne. Was very nice an unexpected.  Staff was very friendly! The rooms are very nice looking. We have a river view on the 20th floor. Was beautiful. Then our ac wasn't working after waiting hours to see if it would get any colder before calling and wasting their time,  never got colder, so called had someone come fix it. They were nice and came shortly after i called. But should of been fixed before arrival. To get to the roof top you are far better going level 1 than going up 1 floor since we were on the 20. The elevators are jam packed so if you go to the main floor and show them your key card u don't have to wait in line and they will get u an elevator right away. Then the horrible, they need to do something about guest at the roof top, they should only be able to go to the roof and main floor. Instead we had someone banging on our door at 2am no stop screaming ""Melissa"". Really?! We had two toddlers with us who then woke up crying. Not to mention since being on the 20th floor right under the bar, all you hear is loud noises and music. Other thing is there is no lock to the bathroom just a sliding door, that doesn't lock. Kind of dumb for rooms with double beds. All in all it is a very nice fancy hotel. I would stay here again not with kids and not on the 20th floor. Not saying anyone was rude to my kids, in fact the employees were most friendly and would help with anything, just not really kid friendly in noiseless level.

I didn't make it to the rooftop bar but I arrived at the hotel at the same time that a group of about 50 people was getting on the elevator - headed to the rooftop bar.  Someone from the hotel immediately grabbed my bag, ushered me away from the group and up the stairs to check in on the second floor.  He was brilliant and my hero.  I see the group as a good thing, but I had just arrived from the airport and all I wanted was room service and a pillow.Room service was a delicious wagyu burger with great fries.  I ordered shortly before the 10:00 deadline (and probably expected to be let down), but the service was very good, and the meal even better.The bed was very comfortable, and the air conditioning worked REALLY well.  It was quite warm, and I often find that hotels don't get cool enough.  I had to turn off the A/C a few hours after arriving as it became quite cold.  Perfect!I had a view of the river, which is always welcomed.  I can't speak to the other side of the hotel.  I selected my room via the Hilton app and was worried I might make a bad choice.  I was on the 16th floor, just a few doors to the right of the elevator bank.  I never heard a thing.  I did notice that the app shows a few guest room doors that appear to be in the elevator bank - as though the doors are adjacent to the elevators - yup, they are.  The rooms are probably perfectly lovely - the door placement seems a bit odd.LondonHouse is a fabulous choice in a neat city.

There is a Nespresso machine in the room with coffee capsules and tea bags of green tea. I personally prefer a keurig and a large cup of coffee in the morning and my husband drinks black tea. They will not provide black teabags as complementary and were going to charge me $10 for a few teabags. What about all the tea drinkers around the world who want just tea!!!   I have never been in a hotel where they did not give you complementary black teabags.I requested from our cleaning lady at 9 AM in person that we were leaving for the day and would be back at 2 PM. Could she please have a room cleaned before 2 PM she acknowledged she understood me, but the room was not clean when we got back at 2:30. Her English comprehension was poor. She did show up about 245 to clean the room. This hotel has a policy of charging your credit card for $100 more a day for incidentals you might use or for damage to the room. We were already paying top dollar for this room and to have 200 extra dollars placed on the credit card after our first night was a shock.

I had booked the Weekend Getaway plan from the hotel website which offered breakfast. During the booking an online chat assistant popped up and I reconfirmed the availability of breakfast as part of the package. Now at $1616.60 for 3 nights which is an average of $500 plus per room night, this is not an average hotel room and one expects certain standards. The problems started at check in where the hurdle of not having an additional credit card for the incidentals had to be overcome. Hotel policy. After some back and forth communication and considerable delay, the issue was resolved and the guests were checked in. The biggest surprise was at breakfast the following morning. The guest  names did not figure on the breakfast list. Another 20 minute wait outside the restaurant and that gets sorted and surprise again. You are eligible for a breakfast of value $11.00 only. What do you get for $11.00? A croissant, a PLAIN omelette, one sausage and a cup of coffee or tea. Great choice. I must say, even in budget hotel chains, the breakfast, when included in the package, is of a decent standard.

There is huge room for improvement starting with management. Upon check- in I entered my room to what was a beautiful view. I then pulled down my bed cover to sit on my bed and do some work only to find a blood stained mattress cover that was covered with a thin too sheet that you can easily see through. It was a stain that never should have been missed by housekeeping. I reported it to management who just offered to have the bed sheets replaced. Did not offer anything else and wasn't overly appologetic for this terrible situation. I later had clients meet me on their rooftop, which does have an amazing view. I called to make a reservation and with much hemming and hawing they gave me a reservation for four. Turned out my clients brought one additional person. So I needed an extra chair. They denied me the extra chair,Claiming they did not have one and rather I had left because of it. They said I needed to be specific with my reservation. In the end two of us shared a seat. Very poor management. I don't recommend staying here. One is better off across the river at Trump!  I'm not a demanding person and no one offered to make the entire experience one that maybe I would consider staying again. Blood on a sheet is inexcusable for a new guest.

I have made reservation directly with hotel because i was booking special University of Chicago rate.  were there with 4 bags for my Daughter's ck in to college. The person was very un empathic and took her a while to go to a higher person to find my reservation. that made us very anxious considering being 800 miles away from home. Next was the Bellman was all nice until it was time to leave, they tried to hail a cab, however they got one that was not big enough for our bags, then they tried to shove it and that made the cab driver very upset, rightly so.Then we were in this cab, with a very MAD driver, driving like a mad man, very unnerving! in fact iI feared for our lives!

This experience tarnished the stay at the hotel and I would never stay there again and consider not staying at other Hilton properties due to this bad experience.I asked them to provide proof of this, and was referred to the front deck and then to other staff and no one could provide anywhere where this was stated on their website or any bookings site that you.

Whenever I want a little break, I'll book a night or two at London House. In my opinion it is the overall #1 hotel in the city for a few reasons. 1) Views. It has the best views of any property here. Get a king vista room (preferably on the 13-18th floors...the room you want ends in a 10...ex. 1610, 1710). These rooms look straight down the Chicago river with views of the bridges and many of the famous buildings. These rooms face west so make sure to get to your room before sunset and watch the sun set over the river and the sky and clouds change. Stay away from the 19th floor because you can get some noise from the bar above. 2) Location. LH is right on the river. Easy walk to anywhere you may need to go for business in the Loop or to shopping on Michigan Ave. Very near almost everything a tourist would want. Restaurants and bars are all around. 3) Value. For comparison, my second favorite hotel in town is the Langham, right across the street. The Langham will run you at least 3-4x the price on a slow night. I can usually get a room at LH in the low $220-$240 range. 4) Modern and Luxurious. The property is new and the technology is tops. Fancy lighting systems. Malin and Goetz bath products. Amazing bed. Maybe my favorite tech feature is fairly unique. They use the Hampton chain digital key system...meaning if you sign up for the Hilton Honors program and download the app to your phone, you can do almost everything during your stay on your phone. You check in, select your room, use your phone as your room key and can text them if you need anything. They are on it. For all you get here, it is my home in my town. Can't recommend LH enough.

No feedback throughout the day. Followed up in the evening and was told they weren't sure if an engineer had checked or not as they had no log history or communication from engineering. Offered to send an engineer to check now but it's 11.30pm and this should have been done during the day with some form of feedback provided.

Had to go down to front desk to resolve but they couldn't find any record of my reservation in spite of the fact that I had already checked in, had a room allocated and slept the night. Two staff kept tapping away on computers unable to find my reservation. Provided my hotels.com booking e-mail, still couldn't find my reservation. Kept asking if I had booked under a different name. All this time making me run late for my morning meeting. Eventually they found my reservation and asked me to try again to connect in the room. Too late as I had to leave for my meeting.3) Came back after a long day out and found our key cards don't work anymore. Had to go down to front desk again tonight to get them fixed. 4) Tried to log onto the Wifi in the room again on my phone this evening and received a warning that the security certificate for ""hhonors"", the hotel's Internet log-in webpage is invalid and poses a security threat. Too tired to deal with this now. So far it has been a very frustrating experience staying at LondonHouse Chicago. Very disappointed with the hotel, short on sleep, and regret choosing this place for our stay.",,,,,,,September 2017,Traveled as a couple,1,1.0

I stayed for two weeks and had to actually ask for the sheets to be changed and they took the bath robe about five days in and didn't replace it. If you come and go at buy times you can wait several minutes for an elevator (we waited nearly ten minutes one night to get out as two of the lifts were out for service and a third was used exclusively to ferry people to the roof top bar. It is a very nice hotel but as you'd expect from a big chain (Hilton in this case) it does have its share of problems, most of which are minor and don't detract too much from the stay but collectively are a little annoying.

The hotel staff is very pretentious and apathetic. Check in was fine but the staff at the front desk are the most unfriendly and unaccommodating people I have ever encountered at a hotel. You better hope you don't have any issues. They will be handled very poorly.     On the first day of our stay we hit the Mag Mile pretty hard. I bought several things for my son, my granddaughter  and for my daughter who was traveling with me. My daughter had taken our purchases out of the bags and left the shopping bags with receipts in them as well as a shoe box on the floor against the wall, NO WHERE NEAR THE GARBAGE CAN. When we came back to our room the following day housekeeping had thrown everything away! Except of course an empty water bottle that we found on the floor between the beds. All of my receipts were gone! Then we discovered that my daughter's toothbrush holder disappeared so we are assuming that was thrown away as well. I called the front desk and they sent someone from housekeeping up to the room. She was kind but not overly concerned. She offered to extend our checkout time two hours later. She said she would look into it and see if the items could be found in the shoot and she would call me. I never got the call. When we returned to our room to retrieve our luggage my digital key had been deactivated and said we were checked out. I went to the front desk and they were not aware our check out time had been extended. I told the gentleman at the front desk what had happened. His response was, ""well, you really don't need receipts you can just exchange whatever you don't want"" REALLY?? I told him I was very upset and that I felt housekeeping should know not to throw away anything that is not in the garbage can. I told him housekeeping said they would call but never did. He said I will talk to them right now. We checked out and left the hotel. Never got a phone call. I called the hotel the following day and spoke with a manager. I believe his name was Mark. I told him what had happened. He asked what I wanted him to do about it. Ummmm, it's your job to figure that out. He asked for my phone number and said he would get back to me. Guess what???  He never called back either!!  Basically, every hotel staff I spoke with said what do you want me to do?  I guess that's my point!  Your housekeeping person threw away over $1,000 in receipts and you can't get them back! I went birthday shopping for my granddaughter and nothing is returnable.      We were supposed to stay here again in October, but we booked a room at the Radisson Blu Aqua. Very nice hotel with a professional staff.     The only friendly staff we encountered were the valet guys but they don't actually work for the hotel. The rooms are just ok. The view is beautiful and that is all this hotel has going for them. The bathroom design is horrible. The glass barn door does not really afford much privacy. The beds sit on a base that sticks out so watch yourself!  I jammed my toes more then once!

We were able to check in four hours early at noon so we didn't have to leave our bags with the bellhop. That was definitely a plus!We went up to the rooftop bar for a drink before dinner and it was characteristically crowded. They allow open seating at the high top tables and reserve the lower tables and the couch type seating.Eight dollars for a Stella or Miller is about you would expect down here. Doesn't make you feel good but you don't feel completely taken either like you do in Manhattan.We headed in and went to the bar one floor below and watched the Cubs game. It was much more relaxed in there and the server was very nice.The room was well appointed. One desk chair by the desk one small reading chair with a tiny table and two very large windows with great views down the river towards the west.The best part of the room was the large TV on the wall and no dresser to take up space because the room was really narrow. There was a high-end fridge behind a door and what appeared to be a nice coffee making unit as well. Bathroom had a nice rain shower, one of those lit up vanity mirrors and plenty of space around the sink for all your toiletries.Our only complaint would be that the doors to the hotel rooms are so heavy that when you go to close them they make a really crashing loud sound. They are just way too loud and they need some sort of mechanism to slow down the action so that they don't make so much noise even if you're trying to hold the door and avoid making so much noise they still make too much.We were on the eighth floor and heard only the smallest amount of street noise. Anything higher than that and it's very quiet.One other small complaint is that the elevators are that new system where you put in your floor number on a keypad while you're waiting to get on and then it tells you which elevator get up to get onto. When trying to get to the roof from our eighth floor we had to wait nearly 5 minutes one time for an elevator. Somehow they need to reconfigure the algorithm that decides which elevators are going up because that was way too long of a wait when there were seven elevators available.",,,,,,,August 2017,Traveled as a couple,317,64.0

Effectively you're charged $30 more than if you'd booked listing 3 people in a room initially. Seems like a poor practice to me. 2.  No pool. ☹️3.  Parking $71?  Park at the underground parking.

Also we happened to be there during the eclipse.  When I called the rooftop bar the manager John had said they might be out of viewing glasses.

Guests are treated to Malin and Goetz amenities ( new sets daily) and fluffy white towels. The bed linen with discreet LH logos woven into the linen and thick fluffy slippers are a respite for tired travelers. The gem in this hotel is the sky lounge on the 22nd floor. You can sip your cocktail or mocktail while watching the sun cast its golden rays on the Chicago river while competing with the 24k gleaming towers of the carbide and carbon building just a stone's throw away.

Within minutes the Hotel manager Alex responded "" It would be his pleasure to make our anniversary special.

I had originally booked myself at the Drake but read recent reviews that the Internet there is defunct and the rooms tired and dreary. I decided to check out other high end Hilton properties last minute and boy was I glad I did. The Londonhouse came up for a very good rate and I booked a King suite with a request to upgrade to a Vista suite (the floor to ceiling windows with views of the river). We arrived way early and our room wasn't ready of course. We spent a few hours in the second floor lounge hoping for a room to open up which didn't happen. Throughout the afternoon the helpful staff were very good about touching base by text as to the progress of getting us a Vista suite on a high floor. That was a wonderful customer service touch! Late afternoon this was successfully achieved. Believe me, this view is definitely worth the upgrade that you are asked if you want after completing your reservation. I could have taken a chance on getting it as a Diamond member, but I think the staff put more effort into it and it only cost me $30 extra. The rooftop bar on the 21st floor offers the same fabulous views I was enjoying from my room. I popped up there with my glass of wine and took a quick look around to observe the pretty young things enjoying themselves. The next morning my son and I enjoyed a to DIE for buffet breakfast on the 21st floor. Buffet breakfasts can be very uneven and tired but the fresh fruit was SO extensive, with granola and nonfat Greek yoghurt. Many breads and pastries, delicious soft scrambled eggs, thick crispy bacon, sausage. In addition, avocado toast. Plus many offerings that the kids will love to include cereals etc. So yummy, my congrats to the staff that makes this buffet above and beyond the ordinary. Should this be offered at a Ritz Carlton, it would be $40 a person I'm guessing. I hate to at this point mention anything negative but just so you don't think I'm a relative of the manager after this glowing review here goes. We arrived at an ungodly early hour on Sunday morning I know. Of course I didn't expect to be placed in a room but I wish that I had been advised that there was breakfast being served on the 21st floor. No mention of that.

Front line staff was polite but not empowered and/or trained to handle customer complaints, compounded with area managers disinterested in showing up to address the problem. Its a new property but you expect the kinks to have been worked out a year in. In-room dining was a disaster - salad was inedible and $20 burger was barely on par with local fast food joint - truffle fries were the only thing on the otherwise skimp menu worth ordering. Every problem encountered seemed to be answered with ""well our policy is ..."" despite it making no sense - refusal to boom a table for party of 3 - because policy says you got to be four - so make sure to lie when you call up to book a table; want to charge me full room rate at checkout despite me booking using standard room point redemption - yeah we do what corporate systems say - its their fault.

There's a very cool rooftop bar and a cozy breakfast areas with fireplace. I suppose the refurb is still taking place as the ground floor was half empty ( restaurant to be open soon). Talking about the lobby - the lift system can keep you waiting in the queue at pick times, so plan some extra time for getting out of into the hotel. The food was bad. Really. Poor selection and poor quality. Quite a surprise given the nice decor in the hotel. The service was even worse. On one occasion the room service knocked on my door and I asked them to come back in 10 minutes as I was in the shower. The lovely lady responded that it's the end of her shift and she would not come back. I was working in my room all day so I know she showed up only 10 minutes before the end of her shift. I normally don't care about room service, but this time I badly needed it - no soap, lots of plates and food leftovers from breakfast etc. Not nice.I went back home and almost forgot about the service, when I realised they added some charges to my bill after I had left and paid for everything. I've been emailing them and leaving voicemails but they are not getting back to me and it's been over a month.

The first 2 night stay were fine except for the parking which is $71 a night.  We had to use it once but moved our car a couple blocks away at a public parking garage for half the price.  The first night we arrived around 3p and were told the roof top bar was closing at 5p for a special event.  The second night storms moved in also closing the rooftop bar. The real problem started on our 3rd night stay when we arrived back from dinner out.  Once we got off on the 20th floor immediately heard loud music.  Once we entered the room we heard a live band playing above our room.  We were leaving the next morning early for a long drive home and there was no way we were getting any rest.  The staff said there were no other rooms available  It just so happened Londonhouse booked a live band on the 21 floor. playing till 11 PM The staff tried to discount our room rates but we couldn't listen to this noise for 3or 4 more hours.  We told the staff employee that we were leaving.  She told the manger on duty (who wouldn't leave the office to speak to us personally) and we went to room to pack.  Within 10 minutes housekeeping was at our door to clean room and we weren't even completely packed yet. I couldn't say anything about the rooftop bar because we never made it.  It seems to me that the Londonhouse is more interested in quantity than quality. They want to book everything they can at the expense of the room guest.

As a Diamond Hilton Honors member, I was pleasantly surprised, but skeptical since we had booked a Vista King suite for my wife, son, and me. Unfortunately the almost 90 minute wait (past 4pm) was the first of a handful of disappointments. I have high floor and away from the elevator in my profile, but we were only on the fifth floor, close to the elevator. Hardly worth the wait.The suite is narrow, with a modest sitting area with a pullout couch separated from the bedroom. The couch and the small sitting room were comfortable and the Chromcast service worked well, so we could stream video from my iPad to the 55"" screen. Unfortunately sitting sitting area doesn't get any air when the bedroom door is closed, so it was not comfortable for sleeping. For a room for this price, I was surprised to see how sloppy the details were. Paint was slopped on one wall, with a good bit on the switches. The sliding glass door looked nice to the bathroom, but hardly kept the sound in the bathroom. Ventilation conducted sound from the neighboring room into ours, so we heard our neighbors from time-to-time. The faucets in the bathroom were unusually loud. The breakfast buffet was pretty good. The offerings were broad. My son thought that the scrambled eggs were surprisingly good for a buffet offering. Although the staff was attentive, sending texts to see how our visit was going, I stopped responding because the problems we were having were not going to be fixable by the staff.The rooftop bar is very nice. Great views of the city, but very busy at night. And drinks are very expensive. It's quite a scene.For a couple, this is probably a much better hotel. Unfortunately for me and my family it was an expensive and less-than-satisfying experience. I cannot recommend the hotel for anyone who wants to use the pullout couch in a suite as a second bed.

However, I checked in online and was not only given a top floor on the river-side, but rather the bottom-most floor on the opposite right next to the elevator. They ALMOST made up for it with a larger suite, so I forgave them. The elevators were down, so it took 10-15 min at times to catch one (sometimes it would come with sardines in tow, no room to get on). Rooftop Bar staff were pretentious, not welcoming, and quite rude. Spent $120+ on a few drinks and tiny appetizers, but the view is indeed breathtaking.

It's an elegant property in a location that can't be beat: close to all the action, including the Magnificent Mile and many shops and restaurants. I loved the hotel's ambiance and historic decor. Pros: - Beautiful rooms, especially the King Vista Room. We stayed on the 5th floor and had a very large, comfortable room. Nice bed (just wish we had a bath tub). - The rooftop bar and upper-level restaurant really made our stay a ""city"" experience. Impressive offering of drinks, all very good, with views that can't be beat. I thought the service in the upper restaurant was very good. It's an experience like nothing else. -We ordered in-room breakfast and the bacon was some of the best I've ever had. Was not expecting it to be THAT good. Cons:  -We paid a lot for our room and were disappointed that it wasn't ready until about 5:30. Yes, we went to get some food and drink, but the 90-minute wait made us concerned something was wrong so we felt a bit ""unsettled."" That said, I did appreciate the real-time text messages from the managers on site re: status updates and being able to make restaurant reservations.-I echo what others have said about the VIP style service at the rooftop bar. I do get that it's one of the ""hot"" areas in town and that comes with ""competitive"" personalities. My husband and I were sitting at one of the tabletops and he got up to get us a drink. I was taking in the view when someone, not staying at the hotel, moved my purse from my husband's chair and just swooped it for one of his friends. Very rude, and not the kind of service one would expect at a hotel of this caliber. Overall, we would definitely stay here again.

I have spend many nights in many hotels around the world. My wife and I decided to spend Forth of July in Chicago. I booked the LondonHouse (paid, not points) based on location and what appeared to be very favorable reviews. We were not disappointed. This hotel is really nice and I would most certainly book again and I would most certainly recommend to friends and tripadvisor users. The hotel is centrally located. From the doormen, to the front desk to the room cleaning ladies...everyone seemed very nice. The downstairs lobby is beautiful. The check in area is very nice. We stayed in room 935 which was a corner room overlooking Wacker street. The rooms are fantastic. Not huge, but what would you expect in a downtown location ? Very clean, very modern. Great views. Very quite if you keep the windows fully closed. Open them up for some ""city sounds"" if you like. Bathroom was excellent. So...this hotel was 95 on my scale of 100. Which is an ""A"" even in accelerated classes !!!Here is what was lacking for the lost 5 points.....Keep in mind....Very few make 100....The rooftop.....This is proudly advertised on the website and many people speak about it.....So some might book this hotel with this amenity in mind. But please know that EVERYONE in Chicago is able to use this amenity. And EVERYONE in Chicago can have the fun of pressing against everyone to try and get a small glimpse of the view. Its really not worth the effort as you will get into a argument with someone who is saving a 2 foot space for their friend who is ""in line downstairs"" to come up. I will say the bartenders are very efficient and nice. The hostesses....not so much...they act like they are in Vegas at a top night club...and with very faint smiles....tell you..""find a spot yourself"". There appears to be a process to ""reserve"" a table ?? But apparently staying at the hotel...or being a diamond level member....gets you the same privileges as everyone else in Chicago. My only recommendation to management is that on busy nights you cordon off the far section (right of bar if facing) for guests of the hotel. My wife and I did not enjoy being told off by some stranger that ""that spot"" (standing area) was being saved""....considering we only wanted to see the view for 3 minutes. Anyway, its what would have given you the extra 5 points.  Other than that, I will stay here again....100%.....",5.0,5.0,4.0,,,,July 2017,Traveled as a couple,27,42.0

We spent the eve of my birthday with drinks and appetizers at The London House Rooftop which has the magnificent view of some of Chicago's iconic architectural buildings. Look so magical at night too! It was a little challenging though getting to the rooftop from my hotel floor as there was  only one working elevator to get to the 21st floor even for us who are booked at the hotel. I wish outside patrons will have another access separate from us who are guests of the hotel. But overall, I highly recommend this hotel if you want to be in the center- this is the center.

I have stayed here for over a week at this point.  This is part of the CURIO collection by Hilton.  From the elevators, to the lobby (on the 2nd floor), including the bar and the rooftop restaurant, this property is a winner.The rooms are incredibly modern, cozy, and a great attention to detail has been given about each light or gadget.  The Chromecast option on the televions (that CURIO seems to be doing at most of their properties) is a big failure. You have to download an app that has about 1 star rating on the APPLE APP store and it does not work.  I ended up spending two 45-min slots with their tech people who couldn't get it to work either.  So each time I see this option, I just ignore it.The main downside to this property, and I did text this to them when they sent me a text asking about my stay, is the coffee.  It is not as bad as a cup of folgers, but it's bad enough that when you use a single serving of a half/half, the coffee turns into a light colored white tea.  It truly is not good quality by any means.  Thankfully, the rooms have a Nespresso maker with three cups each day, so that saves the day for me.  Great touch and a very nice amenity.  The bathrooms are big and the soaps/shampoos/towels are all of high quality.The breakfast for HHonors Gold/Diamond is quite simple, including fresh berries, fruits, croissants, and yoghurt.

The views from the meeting rooms are spectacular, and the staff was very friendly and helpful. It should be noted that the elevator system, while highly technical and ""smart"", it was extremely slow. I'm not sure if some of them were out of order, which I don't think was the case because I rode most all of them. But they were soooo slow and on top of them being slow we had to share them with the outsiders who were visiting the rooftop bar, and there were lots of outsiders. Also, housekeeping didn't come to clean my room until 5pm the first day of my stay, but they came 15 minutes before my checkout when it was time to leave, which was a bit annoying. If you're in a hurry on business travel, this hotel might not be for you, but if you have all the time in the world I recommend checking it out because it's very swanky.

The best part of this hotel is its rooftop bar which provides you with a beautify view of the city. I wish the hotel would give their guests priority access and reservation to this rooftop bar as opposed to the first come first serve basis like anyone one who doesn't stay here.Location wise, it's in the loop with plenty of dining options. It's located right next to the Corner Bakery so you could grab breakfast and lunch there if you like.

My partner and I have stayed at each Hilton property in the loop, downtown, and Gold Coast sections of this all-American city. We recommend the LondonHouse Chicago without hesitation to step-up your next stay in the Windy City. The decor is modern, warm, sophisticated, and inviting. Each of our five stays here have afforded us spacious, contemporary suites offering unparalleled views of the Chicago river and the city's landmark architecture. The restaurant and rooftop terrace and bar are already well-known destinations for locals and visitors alike. The vibe is alluringly trendy, yet with the signature friendliness that this city, and indeed this hotel are both deservedly known for. I've saved the best for last. The staff at the LondonHouse Chicago are true professionals, welcoming each guest as if they were old friends. The unobtrusive contact that guests have with staff throughout their stay is indicative of the latter's flagship-property training, always seeking ways to exceed expectations, even those of well-heeled, seasoned travelers, and veterans of the Hilton brand. We're proud to designate this property our new favorite for our regular monthly visits to the city.

Maintenance reassured me that the fridge was not broken. But they took my stash of breast milk and ice packs and stored them in their general fridge and freezer respectively. They also provided a new fridge which was kept at 40-43F. A few days later, when I checked out, they had lost all the breast milk I had asked them to store! I called an hour before I checked out to have them return the milk from their fridge. They returned the ice packs but did not find the milk I had stored with them. I walked to the front desk and they still were unable to find it. I waited a bit longer but I had to leave to catch my flight. Overall I thought the London House was a reasonable place to stay.

No views from the 21st floor restaurant but good service, good coffee, amazing bacon and relaxing business/hotel guest environment. One floor up is the wonderful outdoor top floor. I stayed in a corner king suite (diamond upgrade from basic room). It's was new and beautiful with amazing views. Room 1735. Large shower, refrigerator, closet with hangers and so on. Room is smaller for a ""corner king"" but for one person and even two it is plenty. It's nothing like a downtown Boston or New York sized room. The 400+ sq feet is plenty and the beauty of the room and hotel is the best I've seen yet as a Diamond member. The beauty of the room is matched to a room in the Wit but the hotel is nicer and, believe it or not, less snotty. I think I gathered this feeling due to the front desk of the LondonHouse being on the 2nd floor. Thus, one never has to walk by them or the little bar or other patrons much. A large bank of elevators quickly brings one to their room. I've only stayed at the Wit otherwise in DT Chicago but I would recommend the LondonHouse over any other Hilton in the location at this time.

Great location.,"I manage events in Chicago so I'm always trying new hotels as prospective locations.  I finally had a chance to stay at the LondonHouse.  Beautiful décor, comfortable yet modern, great location, friendly and helpful staff.  The rooms are nicely done and the one I had was a very good size - especially for this area and price point.  My only suggestion is to housekeeping - they need to pay attention to cobwebs and dust.  With the extra high ceilings, I understand it's not easy to reach, but my room had 2 or 3 noticeable (not inhabited) cobwebs and there was dust on the back side (behind the trinkets, but noticeable from the front) of the display shelves that were in the entrance area of my room. The bathroom could also use more than 1 (hidden behind the towels) power outlet. Granted I travel a lot and I'm picky.  I would definitely stay here again.  I had a tour of the rooftop bar, which was trendy but not club like with pounding base music, but didn't get a chance to partake on this trip (maybe next time).  Overall recommended.  Just need to get housekeeping on top of the cleaning details or the hotel could get aged really quickly.",4.0,,5.0,,3.0,,May 2017,Traveled on business,31,5.0

You just enter on touch screen your desired floor and you are guided promptly to the right and fastest lift. Worked very well and I assume wait time for a lift was significantly shorter because of this technology.I had Hilton app on my phone which allowed me to check in with it and actually even could use the app as my room key.I did not visit reception at all when arriving but just walked straight into my room. Excellent! At least for me who likes this simplicity and not queuing.All traditional reception services were though available.Several staff members at entrance ready to serve. All very good here.Room was very nice. Not average nor bland, but personal and stylish. Great bed. Views amazing at the river, bridges and Chicago's most prominent buildings like Chicago Tribune.Breakfast was served on 21st floor. No windows there but nice environment. Breakfast was good if not amazing, but good value at $19.Little maintenance issues as the shower's glass door did not close properly. I also could not use the safety box because its battery was low, it wouldn't close. I mentioned about the latter issue at the reception. After three days it hadn't been fixed. On last day I requested for late check out, extending it for two hours. I understand it cannot be done if the hotel is full. However if not, it normally has been provided complimentary as a good service almost any time I've needed it. Not this time though. One hour would have been offered complimentary but the second hour for $75. As a Hilton Honors member I expected more, though obviously understand that I cannot demand it. Still, obviously there was no next guest coming.That left a bit sour taste for an otherwise excellent stay. Still, recommend this hotel.

Rooms and the rooftop restaurant have views of historic Chicago buildings including Wrigley, Chicago Tribune-WGN radio, NBC Tower and the Chicago River.

Our room was extremely clean and had a Nespresso machine, smart TV, fridge and a safe for valuables. I would recommend this hotel for families, business travelers, girls night out and couples.  We did have a few problems with our stay. Our room only had one robe and slippers. The vanity mirror and the safe for valuables were not working. Security responded quickly, but it took them an hour to make the safe operable. I was relieved the safe was fixed. However, it took time away from our night on the town. The valet and bell service could have been more welcoming and attentive. A few times we were not greeted leaving or arriving at the hotel. Valet was $71 which is about $10 more than other hotels overnight parking.

There is a very cool vibe about the place, but the entry is a pick cramped ... which lends a pick to the quirky, cool, exclusive feel of the place.Aside from the views, LH is perfectly located for shopping, touring, shows and dining.Although prices are relatively expensive, room sizes are smallish.  We upgraded to a one bedroom Vista Suite and are so glad we got the amazing view of the skyline and the river.  Since the space is so narrow, it doesn't feel that much like a suite, but the little extra room allowed us to spread out a bit.It has a very nice blend of modern and historic elements (e.g. classic marble used in a sleek modern style). Unfortunately the toilet paper holder was broken when we arrived.

My first visit to London house was disappointing.  In summary, it was OK, but I expected more.The Room - new and clean, comfortable bed.  I was in a corner room so no noise from the hall which I like.  Desk up against the wall with a table with a TV on top of it next to the desk.  Chair pushed in the corner.  Wonder why a newly renovated hotel wouldn't have a wall mounted TV and a logical place to sit and watch it.Room Service -- Lacking.  Limited menu, no wine or beverage menu for room service, but you have to ask.  The food was mediocre, service was very lacking.  The delivery person arrived, and left without offering to open wine bottle, left no opener on the tray.  Fortunately, I caught her in the hall and asked if she had an opener.  Her reply was ""There should be one in your room.""  Well, maybe there should be, but there wasn't which was why I was asking.  Took about 25 minutes for an opener to arrive....which was awesome because my food was cold at that point.  Lastly, there is no place to put the food service tray, except for maybe the bench at the foot of the bed, which is what I used after I moved it.  The rolling table that the tray was on was not allowed to stay in the room.Diamond amenities? -- Normally I at least get a welcome note in the room, a bottle of water, a text making sure things are ok.  Not here.In a nutshell, nothing really horrible, but I expected more.  I normally stay at the Palmer House and that's where I will be back to.",,,1.0,3.0,4.0,,May 2017,Traveled on business,10,3.0

The beds were very comfortable and if you like soft pillows you would be in heaven.  The room and and bathroom were clean and appropriately appointed.

This hotel is recently remodeled and very nice. The location can't be beat as it is a quick walk in either direction to everywhere. The room views were nice to look out onto the river. The room we had was on the 9th floor and very small. We did not get the room I reserved due to the hotel letting us check in early at around 11:30. (Our online room I pre-booked wasn't ready until 3/4). That was a sacrifice I was willing to make. The room was new, very nicely decorated, as was the bathroom. Be advised, small room equals bathroom noises easily heard :) also there is no ""door"". It is frosted glass on a rail. So the bathroom door does not close/seal totally shut. It slides with a gap. Weird choice for a bathroom. So if you're not traveling  solo or comfortable with your partner hearing everything-- you might want to look elsewhere. Check in was quick. All staff from the doorman to the front desk and everywhere within the hotel- greeted/acknowledged you but did not go over the top just said hello/acknowledged you and/or smile and asked if there was anything you needed help with.

The exterior and first floor retain most of the architectural details, but the rest is jarringly modern.  LondonHouse is not competitive with the several similarly-priced hotels in the area.  It lacks a dedicated restaurant for breakfast, and its dining venue can't compete with the Langham or nearby upscale eateries.  Rooms are small, austere and lack sufficient storage space (ours had a narrow armoire, drawers beneath the bed and no closet).  Bathrooms are small but functional.  The view from rooms facing the river is impressive - but the glowing ""TRUMP"" sign across the river may be irritating to some.  The location is excellent, but so too are nearby hotels.

Seriously, the location cannot be beat and it was an excellent home base for playing tourist for four days. I arrived ahead of my travelling companion and enjoyed a coffee (albeit an expensive coffee at $7) with a view in the lounge adjacent to the reception area on the second floor. When my companion arrived an hour later, we were cheerfully checked in before the official check-in time, which was appreciated.It is worth spending the extra money to book into one of their ""vista"" rooms - we were in room 1107 and I am attaching a picture of the view from the room (one just has to ignore the other view of the horrendous TRUMP branding across the river). The room itself was large, clean and modern and we enjoyed how quiet it was; we did not hear any noise from our neighbours or from the hallway.The only downfall to this hotel is that it seems that they have made design and appearances a priority over functionality. Let me share a few examples. In a room that could sleep four (we were two), there was only one chair to sit and enjoy the view, there was one small hook in the bathroom (forcing us to throw towels over the glass shower door to dry) and we were supplied with only three coffee pods per day (don't even get me started on the in-room coffee machine because it provided pathetically small cups of coffee and took a Ph.D. scientist two days to figure out how to use) and two coffee mugs. While we didn't fuss over the latter few issues, we did request a second chair and it was cheerfully promised but never delivered. We also requested a wake up call on our check-out morning that didn't happen. We rather felt at every turn that service was friendly and well intentioned but somewhat lacking in delivery.Make sure that you visit the rooftop for magnificent views of Chicago, the river and the lake, but perhaps give their restaurant (On 21) a miss - it was noisy and expensive with small serving portions.At the end of the day I strongly recommend this hotel and I will certainly stay here again should I ever return to the fabulous city of Chicago.",,5.0,4.0,,,4.0,April 2017,Traveled with family,96,20.0

I would not call this hotel kid friendly unless your children are over 21. The rooftop bar is one of the best I've seen in any city luxury hotel. I would recommend it over the Wit and other downtown properties. The bar offers great drinks and appetizers with a price tag to match. There is no shortage of local eats, drinks and entertainment within walking distance.I would recommend this hotel for anyone over the age of 21 and the means to cover the expenses. If your with young children I would recommend the Embassy Suites or Homewood Suites also Hilton properties.",4.0,,5.0,,5.0,,April 2017,Traveled solo,106,63.0

Overall the hotel was a huge disappointment and not worth the price. When we to the front desk at 3:50PM after being notified in the morning our digital key was ready (""Blue"" members have to stop by the front desk before they can use the digital key); housekeeping had not been to the room yet. We waited about over an hour in the lobby for the room to be ready. We saw a number of other guests try to check-in after 4PM and be told their rooms were also not ready. It appears they have a lot of staffing issues in this area. The $18 continental breakfast was just plain bad (we received vouchers after asking because of the issues at check-in). The service at breakfast was non-existent and the selections were not being restocked. The room itself was fine, albeit small. Their location does offer good views of the river if you're on the right side of the building. On the morning of check-out, housekeeping knocked on our door at 8:30AM to see if we were still there and by 9AM our key cards no longer worked (we picked up a pair of key cards after realizing we still had to go the front desk to get the digital key to work) even though check-out is at 12PM.If you're looking for a hotel in downtown Chicago that offers nice accommodations and good service, look at other properties including any of the Kimpton hotels for a boutique experience or Virgin if you truly want something different.",,,1.0,3.0,,3.0,April 2017,Traveled as a couple,7,2.0

I loved the hotel. Rooms were modern and well appointed. High quality towels and toiletries provided. Good water pressure in the shower. Very large flat screen TV. Nexpresso machine instead of a typical coffee machine. It didn't work in the outlet it was plugged into, but they moved it for me. It's nice to have a refrigerator that you can actually use, that's not already filled with stuff. The safe is on the floor in the closet. An odd location but since I don't use the safe, it really didn't affect me. At first glance I could not find a dresser until I realized that there were drawers built into the bottom of the bed. Nice table to work at. Complimentary internet with Hilton Honors. The room was quiet and I had one of the Vista rooms with a great view of the river, and unfortunately the Trump sign on the hotel across the river. I don't care what your political bent is, the sign is too large and obnoxious, and directly across from the hotel, so there is no way to miss it. The bar/restaurant is very nice, although they are not as enthusiastic about using breakfast vouchers as other Hilton properties. After the first day, I didn't try again. Not worth the aggravation and there are some great breakfast spots nearby. For me on a business trip, I was mostly in the room for sleeping and changing so it was perfect. The lobby is on the second floor, so it is a bit harder to interact with the staff. It has one of those modern elevator systems where you type in the floor you want and one of the elevator doors opens. This is great, if you know what floor you want. It doesn't work as well when you type in 1 and get in, only then realizing that the lobby and bar is actually on the second floor, so you have to exit the elevator to go up stairs or type in another number. I really hate these elevators, because sometimes I forget and want to go to the spa/health club or the restaurant, but there is no ability to change your floor once you are in the elevator. I am not in the habit of being that organized to board an elevator. Also, if you get on the wrong one, you are going for a ride.

The lack of service/staff then makes other issues less tolerable (e.g., skimpy and basic Continental breakfast, room coffee service not replenished for 2 days; dirty dishes in the hallway; allowing 2 really loud drunk guys in bathrobes in the restaurant).  Fortunately, I had a great rate and the hotel was a 3 minute walk to the office.Hilton Honors:  All that said, I had planned to stay LH again the following week.  (I'm in Chicago every week for the next 3-months)  I had a reservation for 3 nights but needed to change my reservation to check-in a day later so shortening my stay, not extending it.  I tried to do it via the online reservation system but website showed ""no availability"" to shorten my stay??  Then, I called the hotel directly to be told again ""no availability"" to shorten my stay?? Finally, I contacted Hilton Honors with the first agent telling me.... wait for it.... ""no availability"" to shorten my stay.  I asked to escalate and spoke with an escalation agent who again told me....you guessed it!  ""No availability"" to shorten my stay.  So, I cancelled.

The wine list is quite good and there is a Continental breakfast in the 21st floor bar. Rooms are equipped with Nespresso, though mine was unplugged but impossible to plug in because the outlet was in a cabinet behind a refrigerator. It had to be carried across the room to the desk to brew a cup of coffee.   Inexplicably, too, the safe is on the floor of the in-room armoire, making it difficult to use. Overall, it is a very nice hotel, but it is certainly not a four or five star according to traditional standards.  There's a hip vibe, a vibe that might please the under 40s, but which seems to cut corners to those of us plus 50s looking for a little higher level of service.  In comparison with other Hilton properties in the Loop, the water here doesn't seem to be filtered.  As an Honors member, I did receive two bottles of water today, but once that's gone there is Voss water available in the room for $5 a bottle.

Was welcomed as a diamond member and offered an upgrade without asking. Benefits were well explained and frankly all experience with the main hotel staff were very good. Main letdown during the stay was the poor service during breakfast at the restaurant. Restaurant was unwilling to use the continental breakfast as credits towards other items which isn't the norm but I guess that's up to each hotel to set their respective policy. The main issue was that once the staff knew you were they for the continental breakfast, getting service was tough. We weren't given place settings, had to ask for them and were ignored by the waitress/hostess. In the end, the friendly bartender took the initiative and came from behind the bar to serve us. This happened to a few other groups as well...  Other than that, some minor issues with the housekeeping staff not emptying the trash and not replenishing all the toiletries but nothing too serious. Overall, an average stay and good value for money (at $119) but would like to try one of the other properties nearby instead.. Definitely would not pay the $200+ rates some other posters have mentioned.",4.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,April 2017,Traveled as a couple,1,1.0

But.....,"We arrive for a two night stay and as a Gold Hilton Honors member they were kind enough to let us check in at 11 AM. We were even upgraded to a corner suite! The room was lovely, but the bathroom was literally 2 ft from the bed, didn't love that. We ordered room service both mornings and it was prompt, delicious and reasonably priced.  Great beds & shower & Nespresso. Location is convenient, however the 2 AM motorcycles screaming down Michigan Ave made it difficult to sleep. My biggest issue was with the elevators. We wanted to have a drink at the rooftop bar, and when the elevator door opened there were 10 completely drunk 25-year-olds who are as rude as they could be for the next 13 floors up. There should be a separate express elevator for the rooftop bar. The next afternoon on the way to our room we were met with another crowd like that going up to the rooftop...that's unacceptable. Also the elevators had a terrible smell because of all the party crowds . Are you a hotel or a bar?  make up your mind ..We also had a late checkout, but our key was disabled at 1 PM when we had a 2 PM check out.  We were told WE needed to have it rekeyed... again it is was not seamless service.

Me and my wife did not have to walk far to get anything we needed and plenty of restaurants are within walking distance. Room was large with great view, bed was comfortable, shower was large enough for a whole group of people. We had a room with a great view of the river below.The elevators were comical. I'm pretty sure the system was put in to be as fluid as possible, but I think it does the opposite. 1 couple goes in 1 elevator, then they jam 5 in the next.We did not eat any food purchased from the hotel because there is a small cafe on the bottom floor that has some good breakfast foods.Now my issue was the service. I drove into the city and called beforehand and when I asked if there was a parking deck at the hotel I was told yes. Well after driving around the block 3 times on a Friday night I realized that was incorrect. Pulled up in front of the hotel in the middle of the street after I saw someone else do it and that triggered someone to come to my vehicle and get my keys. It's not very obvious what to do. I wasn't told where to go, just given a ticket. Found lobby on second floor and interacted with someone who probably thought I didn't belong there in his hotel because he didn't seem to enthusiastic to be dealing with me.Later in the evening I was told to move away from the building while smoking a cigarette. Mind you there was a young crowd all dressed up hanging around close to the front door, but didn't say anything to them.I'm a HHonor member who is usually gold or diamond year after year. I've been loyal to Hilton, but I'm finding the service lacks more and more with these other properties Hilton has under there wings (with the exception to the Waldorf properties). Yes they have big, beautiful, and expansive properties, but the service just lacks. They also put a hold of $200 on my CC for incidentals. I was told this was common practice after I called and asked why $200 more is being added to my bill because a larger amount in currently pending. I've stayed at plenty of other hotels and none do this. This is something that should be told upfront so I'm not calling HHonors then the hotel 3 hours after I check out.",,,,,,,April 2017,Traveled as a couple,48,15.0

The quality of the finish to the new rooms was high and, although the room was quite narrow, it was perfect for me.

I decided to take the short walk to Benny's the other side of the river, and it as a great choice for me; see separate review.I had been warned that the rooftop terrace gets very busy, and on the night of my stay it was no exception.  I had a quick look at the view and then went back down to the indoor bar for a drink, where prices were relatively high and service was nothing special if I'm honest.  Perhaps a visit to the terrace earlier in the evening would have been a better choice.Breakfast in the morning was quite busy although there was a fair spread on offer, including a popular cooked to order omelette station.

Returned to our room several hours later, no pillows, so I called guest services.  Told them second request, they said ""I'll get right on it.""  Came back at 1 am, no foam pillows.  Day 2, went to front desk and requested two foam pillows again, told them it was our third request.  They said ""I'll get right on it."" My husband also left a note for housekeeping.  When we got back that evening, we had ONE foam pillow.  That's when we gave up and accepted that one of us would have a neck ache this entire trip.Service in the restaurant at breakfast was extremely slow to non-existent.  Day 1, we waited a very long time to order.  My husband ordered pancakes, they brought him an omelette.  By the time they made the right order, I was done eating.  Then we had to wait for the bill.  Next two breakfasts, we did continental, STILL had to wait for a bill to leave a tip.  Very frustrating.  If you want a quick breakfast, go anywhere else.  Also, if you want the continental breakfast, go early. They don't replenish often, so by the last half hour your choices beyond toast and fruit are pretty limited. (No cereal except oatmeal, very little fruit, pretty slim all the way through.)On the plus side, every employee we saw in the common areas said good morning/afternoon or hello.  Very friendly.Also, the afternoon concierge, Anthony, was very helpful in finding us a dinner reservation for 8. The restaurant he recommended was outstanding. Bottom line: if you don't like extremely soft pillows, bring your own because they can't seem to bring anything else.  And if you don't want a long wait for breakfast, eat somewhere else.

I come to this area three times per year and have stayed in many hotels in this area. Everyone in my group was really impressed with this one. It's very well appointed and modern feeling in a great location. Staff were helpful and attentive. The second floor lounge is a great little hangout spot with a fantastic view. The hotel toiletries I usually don't find worth a mention but these were special and are going home with me. The elevators were oddly confusing and a source of entertainment throughout my stay as I laughed at self and others.

When traveling, I prefer to not stay at the host conference hotel (services suffer, too crowded).  My search offered LondonHouse as an alternative and I loved the boutique feel of the place.  This is a new property (not sure what it was before LondonHouse) and, upon arrival, I was very pleasantly surprised.  First, I was allowed via the app to select my room ahead of time and it was ready when I arrived.  Had a very comfortable and well appointed room on the 20th floor with great views of the Chicago River and N. Michigan Ave.  Oh, I forgot to mention that I was born/raised in Chicago!  Only concern I had w/the 20th floor room was the restaurant/bar was on the 21st floor and I could hear tables/chairs being moved from time to time - not enough to become a real concern though.  Room was super clean, comfortable bedding, and bathroom spotless.  Room had a small sitting area (in the corner) and a Nespresso Machine.  Wow - I hadn't used one before but now planning to purchase one.  Used the fitness center and though small it had very good equipment, free weights, and a separate area for core exercises.  TV monitors on treadmill and elliptical machines are huge.  The only reason I didn't give LH an excellent rating was the service lapses, especially from the housekeeping staff.  Front Desk staff was very good/attentive.  I actually had to make 3 separate calls to have my room cleaned.  By the 3rd call, i'd decided that all I needed was to have my towels and coffee replenished (as I was not ready to take a long nap).  HK arrived with coffee but not towels, then with only the very large towels and not face/hand ones.  They got it right eventually but I attribute it to this being a new property and service kinks still being worked out.  The Bell Staff were also fine but one of my pet peeves is to be hounded to assist with bags - when it's clear that I don't need assistance.  Finally, the location is 2nd to none! If you want shopping, there's N. Michigan Ave right out the front door - or State Street in the other direction - all very short walks.  Overall, this is definitely among my new top facilities to stay whenever I'm in Chicago.  Again, glad I stumbled upon this place!",4.0,,4.0,,,5.0,March 2017,Traveled on business,67,94.0

The building is beautiful and well preserved from the 1920's with classical features (marble walls for example), and then completely updated and modern rooms. The location may be the best in Chicago, on a wide boulevard intersecting Wacker and Michigan Avenues, it is very easy to drive to and to get anywhere in Chicago from. There are stunning river views from every floor, with huge windows to enjoy the views from.The lobby's open bar and restaurant is comfortable with beautiful views and attentive friendly service. The 21st floor restaurant and bar has the best lunch special in town with a 3 course meal and cocktail for $20. It was delicious. It does seem to be a hot spot for young locals and deservedly so. The 21st floor outdoor bar and lounge is spectacular with stunning views. The rooms are attractive, comfortable and quiet. The beds are very comfy and the housekeeping service was excellent.

I had never had a facial before purchasing the service here and I was quite excited and hopeful for a positive experience. I was beyond impressed with what I received. My esthetician Cassandra was warm and welcoming all while being extremely professional the entire time. She is sure to describe all that she is doing should you ask so you know exactly what is occurring if you are curious like I was. Or if you are a more frequent facial customer, she keeps the experience very serene and peaceful so you can enjoy the service to the fullest extent possible. I purchased the hydrafacial and I left the spa with my skin feeling so rejuvenated and moisturized!

I had points to use so we tried a new hotel, The Londonhouse. Firstly, what  great location! The hotel is located basically right on the Chicago River, right off of Michigan Avenue. But there are many hotels in Chicago with a great location. It takes more than that for me. The Londonhouse delivers.Like every Hilton I have been in, the people are fantastic. From the valets to the bellmen to the front desk to the people in the bars, everyone was so professional but also outgoing. All seemed to truly care about my needs. We arrived shortly after 3pm. Our room was not ready. Zonnie, at the front desk, was extremely helpful. She took time to see if there was an upgrade that would work. There was not (we already had a suite reserved so there wasn't a lot to upgrade). She offered us two complimentary drinks at the bar in the lobby, stating she would put a rush on our room.Speaking of the bar, there are two in the hotel. The lobby bar has a great view of the Chicago River and is great for people watching. It is quiet and there was a gentleman playing keyboard. The hotel has some signature drinks. I tried the old fashion. It was fantastic! The other bar is on the 21st floor with rooftop availability. This bar serves meals and the music is louder. The vibe is more ""hip."" My wife and I agreed, we like the more subdued atmosphere of the lobby bar. To each his own...Our room was magnificent. It was large, clean and well appointed. The bedroom was separate from a nice living room area. The bathroom was down the hall and was quite large and plenty bright. Plenty of room for the both of us to get ready at the same time. Two large flat screens, one in the bedroom, one in the living room made it fun to watch the NCAA basketball tournament when we were in between events.We have stayed at many hotels in Chicago. There is one in particular that we frequent. It would take a lot for me to change to a new ""go to"" hotel. This one just may do it. I put a high premium on the people. The Londonhouse scores a perfect ""ten"" with it's people. The rest is just icing on the cake. If you want a well located hotel on or just off Michigan Avenue, stop searching.

Sometimes I am here just one night; sometimes for 4 or 5 days in a row.  My go-to hotel was the old Conrad.  It became the Glen, although a new Conrad has opened.  I had been waiting for the Londonhouse to open for quite some time.   The location is absolutely perfect for walking to meetings in the Loop, but also walking to Michigan Avenue.  You're really just close to so many things.  The staff is incredible, also.  They text you to make sure that things are going ok and yet they aren't intrusive.  The elevators are awesomely cool -- you program in the floor you want and you're directed to an elevator.  It does cut down on the traffic of waiting for an elevator.I have to admit I am a Hilton Diamond member, so I probably get some perks that other don't, but certainly less perks than a Doubletree Inn.I can't say enough about the beds or the bedding.  I wish I could just take it home with me. The showers are nice, but I wish they had included a removable handle for the shower head.  I love that they give you a small sponge so the delightful body wash isn't ruined by using a washcloth.The breakfast could use some help.

Sorry Gwen and Conrad, I feel like I'm cheating on you.Let's start with the location. While it's across the bridge, it's the closest you can be to the Michigan Avenue action on this side of it. The big plus is you're closer to the theater district.The decor is insanely great. Each tiny detail is absolutely perfect. And it's just not perfect in the common areas. The room details are exquisite. From the etchings in the sliding bathroom doors to the perfect, fresh light fixtures to the built in cabinetry, it's all flawless.They use Malin+Goetz toiletries, which I usually order, I love so much. Even the stupid things like the commode flusher is cool. Their elevators are timed perfectly, too.I had to find something wrong with this place, so I decided it had to be in the hot water and how long it takes to get hot. So, I timed it.

However, I'm downgrading that to reflect further experience.First the good. The location is outstanding. Close to theaters, shopping, Michigan Avenue, Millennium Park. Staff is nice.Now for the not so good. We booked a one bedroom suite. The desk is in the small bedroom, and the living room is just tiny. The room is very dark, and the (hard to operate) lighting can't compensate.Just like the room isn't enough, well, room, it doesn't have enough of a lot of other necessities. Five hangers is not enough for one person, much less two. Nespresso is nice, but two pods and one sugar is barely a portion for one (even though two cups are provided). Only two drinking glasses in the bathroom. Both dirty. No other glasses to be found. I know one can request more coffee and hangers, you shouldn't have to. We requested more coffee before we went out, came back much later to find request not met. Called again. They brought up a hodgepodge of coffee stuff in what was clearly a used Ziploc baggie. In addition to the dirty glasses, we found debris of some sort next to the desk. Never picked up the entire time we were there.Other odd details: the safe is on the floor in the closet. The drawers are under the bed. All very nice if you are low to the ground but most people aren't two feet tall. The somewhat frosted glass barn door to the bathroom is odd. No way to use the bathroom unless everyone is very familiar with each other. The closet is also small and the sliding doors don't really slide but will grudgingly move if enough force is applied. Only a tiny portion of the shower handle can be used to hang towels. No other towel bars. At. All.The final annoyance with this place was that the last two nights were confirmed at a slightly lower rate than the first. I called to check out and they emailed the invoice. They charged the higher rate for all three nights. HHonors customer service asked the hotel to fix it. They never did.",3.0,5.0,1.0,,,,March 2017,Traveled as a couple,78,96.0

I absolutely loved it (apart from one aspect which I will cover later).  The hotel is modern, slightly funky but not forced.  It was warm, inviting and friendly.  I checked in and although my first room was near a loud ice machine, so I asked to be moved, my second room was wonderful.  And as it turns out had a great view of the turning the river green ceremony!The lobby is on the 2nd floor, along with a bar.  The staff were really friendly and I got an upgrade for being a Diamond Member, along with a voucher for breakfast on the 21 Floor restaurant.  The room was wonderful - actually one of the best hotel rooms I have stayed in.  It was not over the top luxurious so it was homely and cosy.  A great layout and a wonderful bathroom.  The amenities were high end too - not the use Hilton ones.  The bed was so comfortable - in fact I am annoyed as I was going to look for a brand -  I have issues with my back in some hotels but not this one.  I slept wonderfully. There were sockets in the right place and the hairdryer was of good quality.I had a few drinks and some food in the bar.  This is the only thing I would ask the manager to look at - the staff in there were a little off-putting.  There was a barman who thought he was auditioning for a cabaret show and took all the attention towards him in a quiet bar relaxing bar.  In fact he kept raising his voice to go over the jazz duo!!.  I was also disappointed that when I ordered a LH daiquiri off the menu, he made a big song and dance about how he had never done one and he had no idea how to make it and what was he supposed to do with the black lime that it was topped with!  I very nearly went over and said dont bother, pour me a wine!  The bar lady that took over from him was in a right sulk about something and at one stage stormed off - I was not sure she would be back but when she was she was quite unprofessional talking about how 'management...etc etc' - something to do with stock levels.  I say this as I thought it was a little odd to have such unprofessional folks in a bar that was high end and had a great atmosphere!  There was a lady with long red hair that did her best to calm everything down and deserved a medal!Normally, I would take a star off for something like that, however this hotel is that good that I just couldnt - I just hope management have a word.  Location wise you cant get much better - it is right in the centre of things and next to the picturesque part of the city.

We reserved a King corner studio suite. We were located on the 17th floor of the hotel. After walking in the place it looks just amazing! From the front desk to our room. We ended up with the most amazing views! Front view of the city and if we looked out the side window we could look right down at the lake. The Nespresso was a great touch in the room. Bed was so comfortable, plenty of hot water and great extras in the bathroom. We enjoyed the bar on 21st floor however $34.00 for 2 drinks was very expensive even for Chicago! We had the breakfast included the next day and it's also served in the bar in the mornings. It would have been a great breakfast BUT the service was terrible. We asked for coffee and juice that took a good 20 minutes to get. Once we got our breakfast then we were ignored until they came to take our plates and he took my plate before I was finished and cleaned the table. We ended up just leaving at that point. Overall we will stay here again but we won't be going here for a meal. It turned me off that all the service wasn't the same level throughout the hotel. The front desk was great and the bartender & waitresses were fantastic but during the breakfast it seemed that many of the employees could care less if you have a good experience or not.

Style. Service.,"Older converted hotel that is part of Hilton's Curio Collection (you get points *and* character). The lobby area is very nicely designed and is manned by some top-notch people. Finding my room was a bit tricky as I'll argue that the little signs outside the elevators on each floor (rooms ""100-105 that way"" etc) aren't clearly laid out. Then again, I may just be slow-witted (or a slow-witted person who sleeps in hotels many times a week).For an old hotel, the rooms are nicely sized - which is usually not the case with these converted older properties. Great bathroom. Great shower. Comfortable bed and a nice desk for working. Oh, the windows open a bit which is great if it's february and the weather is in the 60's for some reason. View of the river and the city is spectacular - even though there is a huge TRUMP sign on the building across the street.

I arrived just a few days after it opened. As I walked into the hotel I was greeted by the valet and bell staff. I always travel light so I didn't need luggage assistance but I did ask them for directions to the lobby. The lobby was located on the 2nd floor and had beautiful lighting and art hugging the walls. I was greeted by Savanah who checked me into my reservation. She explained my Honors benefits that included daily breakfast, wifi, and a little information on the area. The guest room was modern, sheek, and just stunning. As you walk in there is a restroom with a giant glass shower and a rainfall shower head, the amenities were luxury as well. The space smelled clean and fresh, which is exactly what you expect. Next was a good sized living room with a sofa, table, TV, and espresso coffee maker (which was impressive). The bedroom had a king sized bed with crisp white linen, plenty of lighting, a small work desk, TV, nice sized closet space, and floor to ceiling windows that overlooked Chicago's riverfront. The view was worth a thousand dollars itself. It was evident that the AC was not functioning, but after a phone call a technician quickly addressed the issue and there were no further problems. The morning breakfast was located on the lobby level. Fresh coffee, pastries, fruit, yogurt, and a cook making fresh omelets and eggs. I also had the chance to visit the upstairs lounge/bar. Their selection of whiskey was nice but the crowd was stiff, nothing against the hotel of course. Overall the accommodations were superb but the staff was the star of the show.

Wacker Drive at Michigan Avenue is a busy, busy location, but I was surprised at how quiet the room was!Our check-in experience was very good. The staff is great about checking up on you to be sure you are comfortable and to ask if you need anything. The room we were in was small, but beautifully appointed. At first we thought there was hardly any drawer space to put things away, but...be aware that there are spacious drawers under the bed.We really liked the lobby bar, and spent a little time there every day we were guests. The bar on the 21st floor is nice, but when we checked it out it was crowded and too noisy for us to enjoy. I guess you can call us old farts for that.Just 2 things kept me from rating a 4 instead of 5. First, I was a little surprised that you could walk in from the street and take the elevators directly to guest floors without inserting a room key. This, to me, is a security issue that made me a little uncomfortable. Second, we had breakfast 2 mornings on the 21st floor. First time was OK. Second time, our food was inedible. My husband's skillet breakfast was very dry, and his eggs on top extremely overcooked. My pancakes, although hot, were flavorless (how is that even possible?), and gooey and under-cooked on the inside. We did not complain, because we had free breakfast coupons. Also on this morning, my husband was seated for at least 5 minutes before he got coffee.

What I had not anticipated was the excellent quality of the finishes and details of the building itself, or the quality of decor in the room. This is top notch.The room was spacious and very comfortable, with plush carpets, a very comfy bed, good size desk and ample hanging and closet space. The bathroom equally roomy,  with a good size walk in shower. But it is the extra touches - Malin+Goetz toiletries,  books on the shelves, blue tooth facility on the HiFi, Chromecast on the TV, and high speed WiFi for $6 per day. The view sideways from the room is a special one, looking down the line of bridges across the Chicago river. The view directly opposite is less special, as you face straight into the Trump tower parking garage or his 2 storey high illuminated sign high dominates the lower 15 floors.A small note of caution, if you book your room through a third party site (such as Booking.com) you will not receive Hhonors points. You have to book through directly through Hilton to get them. This is not something I was previously aware of, and given that there are other equally high quality places to stay in this part of Chicago, is a policy that Hilton may need to reconsider in the age of online hotel booking sites, as I feel that I should be rewarded for choosing to spend my dollars with Hilton.",,,,,,,February 2017,Traveled on business,143,22.0

Because we had managed to secure reservations at Alinea for dinner one night, we extended our stay for an additional day and a half.We have stayed in the general area (hosting organization’s offices are on the River too), but always at other properties. We were impressed by the LondonHouse, from the moment we checked in, until we departed. We were greeted as HHonors Diamond members, and given an upgrade room (Corner), free WiFi (did not use, so cannot comment on speed, or reliability), and two bottles of water. As our room was ready (we were quite early for check-in, and I had anticipated spending time in either the lobby bar, Bridges, or upstairs in the Tri-level Rooftop Bar), we unpacked and did head to the Tri-level Bar for a bit of light lunch, prior to my wife’s meetings.The room, 835, was in the original part of the historic, London Guarantee and Accident Building, structure (there is a glass and steel “tower” next to that), and while not large, did have an interesting floor plan. It was a “suite,” but the sitting/desk area/entrance hall was small, as was the bedroom, but with a good utilization of the actual space, it felt larger, than it really was. Being on a corner meant that we had views in two directions – directly upon the River, across from Trump Tower, as well as down-river to Lake Michigan. Both views were very nice, and changed throughout the day/night, as the sunlight changed and the lights came on.The room has a comfortable King bed, four good pillows and a swivel, large-screen TV, that can be viewed from the bed, or from the sitting area – nice feature. The bathroom is directly off of the bedroom, and while large, with a walk-in shower and single sink and vanity, it seemed a bit too close to the bed, and with a frosted-glass “barn door,” not quite as “private,” as I would have liked. The toilet was a dual-flush “European” model of Toto. While the water pressure in 835 was adequate, it would have been nice to have an adjustable shower head. Ours functioned fine, but only allowed a rather broad spray. We had a full array of nice Malin+Goetz bathroom amenities.At the entrance hall, the room had a cabinet with a mini-fridge, storage space, and a Nespresso coffeemaker. There is a closet, just to the left of the entrance door, with mirrored doors, but the closet doors were rather sticky, and reported to the hotel for maintenance. The closet also had a safe, mounted onto the floor, but it opened at the top, unlike many, so one did not have to lie on the floor, to access it. It also featured a light, when initially opened, which is a good feature, and one that I am seeing more often in hotel rooms.The room windows all had both sheers, and then blackout curtains, which were all manual. Due to their location, and the chains to operate, it would have been nice, if those were automated. We had no issues closing the blackout drapes fully, on any of the windows. The curtains on the large window in the bathroom did get a bit of a workout. This window did not have privacy sheers, but only the blackout curtains – a combo of both would have been ideal.There was adequate drawer space for our short stay, and additional under-bed drawers (did not use those), for more storage.Our room was quiet, though we did hear a few motorcycles in the concrete corridors of the Loop, and a couple of emergency vehicles, on the second night. We heard zero noise from other rooms, or the hallway.There is a small exercise room (did not use), and a Spa, which is small, but very quiet and nice, on-property. Also, there are the afore mentioned Bridges Lobby Bar, and the Tri-level Rooftop Bar/restaurant.In all, a very comfortable room, and a lovely renovation to an historic building. The décor is quite modern, so a departure from the outside of the building, and while a bit minimalist, it was very pleasing to my eye, and aesthetic sense. Coupled with the very helpful, efficient and friendly service, from the doorman, to the reservation agents, the Concierge, and all bartenders, and waitstaff, our stay was very good, and we look forward to staying at the LondonHouse in the future – location is perfect (shopping, dining and business in/near the Loop all right outside the doors), and hospitality excellent.",,5.0,5.0,,5.0,,February 2017,Traveled on business,166281,2721.0

A TV wall separates the entry area from the sleeping quarters creating an intimate and thoughtfully partitioned room. Bathrooms are spacious and spa-quality. The views are incredible and worth the cost of an upgrade. Although the rooftop bar was closed during our February visit, they did allow viewing from the terraces; incredible views. It certainly must be the go-to-place in the warmer months. The concierge was very knowledgeable about the area and all the staff went above and beyond to meet expectations.

We mentioned it was our first anniversary and they moved us to a king room on the corner of the building.  We had 7 windows in our room with at least 3 different views of  Michigan Avenue and the river.  Again. We couldn't have been happier.  As a new hotel they are doing everything right. We came back on our first night to our room and they left us chocolate and champagne with a happy anniversary note.  That made our night and weekend even better. The staff was awesome Keith, Bryan and Daniel were all amazing and immediately answered all of our questions and text messages within seconds.

Overall, the hotel was nice. The staff, in particular, were excellent and made us feel right at home, even though we were beanie-and-jeans wearing travelers who looked completely out of place in such a swank hotel. The location is excellent, just a short walk to the L and right on Michigan so you can take a number of buses up north. We chose to pay a little extra and stay in a room a bit higher above the street, so we had an amazing view of the river and the lake, which was fantastic. It was wonderful to wake up every morning to that view.The beds were comfortable and the huge TV with multiple apps on it was a good way to unwind at the end of the day. I liked that there was a small refrigerator in the room. The room was very quiet and had it's own climate control, which was nice as we like to sleep in a cool room, so we were able to run the fan all night and stay comfortable.Now for the not-so-great quirks. While the bed was comfy, the pillows were terrible. They were king-size duck down pillows that were hard and flattened out to the point that even sleeping on your back it felt like your head was below the rest of your body. I ended up putting a towel under mine to support my neck, which helped, but wasn't ideal. Also, and this is a common complaint at many hotels, but the curtains didn't close completely, so there was always a small gap of light coming through. Why hotels don't put magnets or some other fastener in their curtains, I'll never know. But the gap in the curtains was nothing compared to the horrible blue LEDs on every light switch in the room. Study after study has shown that the blue light emitted by LCD and LED lights messes with our brain chemistry and makes it hard to get a good night's sleep. In addition, blue and green LEDs emit very bright light compared to orange or red ones. The light was so bright from just these LEDs that I could easily see around the room at night and I had to cover the ones next to the bed because they were keeping me awake. Finally, the bathroom door is a barn-style door that offers no privacy. You can hear (and smell) everything coming from the bathroom, which isn't very pleasant. In summary, the LondonHouse is a cool hotel with some neat features, a good location, and a great price, but it is almost to hip for its own good, which detracts from its comfort and purpose as a place to catch some rest.",,,5.0,3.0,5.0,,February 2017,Traveled as a couple,23,14.0

Rooms are spotless with lovely decor and linens on the bed with plenty of fluffy towels in the bathroom.The not so good - the fan in the bathroom switches on / off every 5 minutes so not good for trying to get to sleep.  Ended up calling down an they came to turn it off - apparently it is meant to do this to keep the bathroom warm.  Not ideal.  The room was fairly small and the lighting not brilliant - as has been mentioned in other reviews.  I didn't find the bed that comfortable so didnt sleep to well unfortunately.The elevators do not have floor buttons inside but a ""touchscreen"" outside - fine if you hit the right button to start but if you hover over any number it will double up example instead of hitting 17 if you hover over the 1 it gives you 11. so you then have to go to another pad and try again!

We booked a few days before our date of arrival and got a Hilton Honors rate of $97. I'm not sure if their rates are usually this good for weekend stays, but neither myself nor my friend had stayed here before and we couldn't find a better rate anywhere else. The service is very inviting and professional at the front desk. In addition, the lobby has a bar with windows that overlook the Chicago River and surrounding architecture. We didn't have a drink there, but it would be a nice place to do so. There is a ton of seating.Our room was very modern and well-appointed, with books and nicely selected furnishings. The TV was very large, as was the bathroom. The front desk agent who checked us in provided us with a room that had a direct-facing view of the river and the Trump Tower. It wasn't the $25 upgrade we were offered that would have had floor to ceiling windows, but the view was very nice  no less. The noon checkout time was ideal; we were able to sleep in on Sunday morning and enjoy our coffee in the room before we had to leave.

Lots of things are within walking distance both north and south and it's close to the El, though with four of us traveling together, Uber turned out to be cheaper than public transport would have been, and warmer since it was door to door. Room: Although right next to the elevator it was very quiet. Couple of things, design-wise....(sometimes I think the designers should spend a night in the rooms). The little ""lobby"" inside the door is crying out for a row of hooks or a coat stand. If wet, you have nowhere else to hang coats other than in the closet. The shower if not adjusted towards the wall, would spray water over the floor whilst it was warming up due to the way the shower door opened. Not a fan of the sliding glass door on the bathroom, huge gaps all around it so little privacy sound-wise. Enjoyed the Nespresso machine and the lovely Malin & Goetz toiletries. The pouf was a nice touch too.Breakfast: From booking with a AAA deal, breakfast was included. We were given cards for this at the front desk on arrival. They entitled us to the continental breakfast inc. tea/coffee/juice or we could spend up to $18 (with beverages separate) from the menu. I have to say, as a frequent traveler the continental breakfast for $18 was one of the sorriest breakfasts I have ever seen. Tubs of very pedestrian yogurt, pedestrian fruit, bread, and small pastries and cereal. No cold cuts, cheeses or eggs, I guess their main audience is the business traveler on an expense acct. Needless to say, we chose from the menu and the omelette for example came with toast and fruit which was great, and with a beverage, within the $18. Service was slow. The Corner Bakery Cafe is downstairs if you prefer a choice.Would I stay here again? Hmmmm, maybe. We had an incident with the security swing bar closing us out of the room one day. Despite the housekeeper requesting help earlier in the day, no one came till we made a fuss on returning at 7pm and therefore no hk till after 9.30pm. Then, just a pile of towels. I didn't feel as though anyone owned the problem.I think this reads a little negatively though overall we did enjoy staying at the hotel.

The bathroom was big and offered a beautiful setting with a walk-in shower.  Everyday our room was cleaned and a staff member text me several times during my stay to ensure I was satisfied.

The building was also built in the 20s, which was a big selling point for me, as I love the roaring 20s!  One of their signature cocktails actually is also called the Roaring Twenties and I recommend having one or maybe two ;)  And if you are able to go to the roof top - DO IT!  One of the best views of this beautiful city and I have seen many!  The room was perfect with a million dollar view of the river - we were on the 15th floor.

Location was easy to find as we drove into town and we had incredible views. It is within walking distance of all our favorite Chicago fun...museums, dining, shopping...perfectly situated to enjoy both north and south Michigan Ave. The decor reminded me of jazz age updated to this millenium with it modern take on historical fixtures. Every staff member from front desk, to valets, to housekeeping and restaurant staff was friendly and helpful. Room size was larger than we expected and full of amenities that were little things that just made the stay more comfortable. Loved the espresso machine and supplies in the bathroom (q-tips make us smile). The elevator system was awesome....no trying to guess which door you should aim for as it is programmed based on your destination (you put in the floor and it tells you which door will open). This is really nice when your arms are full. Valet parking would have been pricey for us because we needed to park 2 vehicles for 2 nights, but there is less expensive public parking nearby that worked well for us at half the cost. We wouldn't let that stop us from staying here again and we actually plan on doing so when we come back for the same event next year.

Let me say that the hotel itself lives up the ratings.  The service is friendly and prompt.  They even text you to see if you need anything about an hour after check in!  The smart elevators are a neat touch.  The rooms are clean and modern.  Our room was also surprisingly quiet considering the busy area and the fact that we were right next to the elevator.  The only reason I did not give 5 stars is because the restaurant service was abysmal.  We had to wait (no kidding) 21 minutes to get someone to bring us our coffee, and event then the server forgot the sugar and milk/ cream. What should have been a quick twenty minute breakfast was an hour long.  It was't even busy. Half the tables were empty.

From the great location to the stunning views, the wonderful and attentive staff and the amazing food....the LondonHouse Chicago is, well, amazing!  When we booked our both business/romantic couples getaway we did go with a king vista room....which by no means is at the top or the bottom of the ""food chain"" of room choices but it is a room choice about right in the middle of the choices.  We stayed over the MLK holiday weekend and got a fantastic price working directly off of the LondonHouse/Hilton website so no ""reseller"" deal was needed or wanted.  The ease of booking the room was an initial highlight as most of the room choices populate on the site as you check one box or the next. Our King Vista room on the 14th floor facing the Chicago River could not have been nicer or more comfortable.  It was large and well appointed without being too large or overwhelming with wasted space.  To say it was quiet and that we were undisturbed is an understatement.  We had neighbors but you would have never known.  Noise in this hotel is non-existent anywhere.  Our king bed...faced a very large (probably 55 inch) LED TV with most of the channels you could ask for but why stay in when you can either explore Chicago or just sit in a chair by the ""floor to ceiling"" windows and watch the world go by.  To put a finer point on this room....while parking the car before I entered....my wife texted me when she got to the room with a text that said......""Honey....in a word....WOW!""  The marble bathroom was very nice with a walk in two person shower (sorry for those needing a bath tub....not in this particular room) ;~}There is a Nespresso Coffee maker in the room and all the supplies you could need.  The toiletries were great and plentiful.  We did attend an event at the hotel and the meal was absolutely the best meal I have had in a long while.  And I am including many top notch restaurants in that assessment.  Truly it was a fantastic meal with tremendous service. The event rooms had wonderful views and balconies from both the 3rd and 21st floor overlooking the city and some other hotel next door.....it was hard to read the sign so not sure what that hotel name said....the letters were quite small....when you get there you will get that reference (joke). Although we did not make it out to the rooftop bar/deck as it was quite cold in January in Chicago....from what I have read, seen and been told....the outdoor rooftop bar/relaxation space is NOT, repeat NOT, to be missed.  Finally, just viewing the architecturally significant building in an architecturally significant town like Chicago, in a very historic area (Ft. Dearborn) it makes me proud to say.....I am a Chicagoan and could have gone wherever I wanted but I chose the LondonHouse Chicago!

The views were absolutely stunning! The room had a large bathroom with Frette robe and wonderful thick towels, toiletries, and makeup mirror. There was a sitting room with sofa and two stools under a sofa table that held the Nespresso coffee machine (nice!) and a door that led into the bedroom area. Wow! Floor to ceiling windows overlooking the river were fantastic. Incredibly comfortable king size bed, desk, a wardrobe, nightstands, lights on dimmers (which I love) a chair and small table by the window. Wonderful. The staff at the hotel was incredibly professional and friendly. Everyone said hello and offered to help in any way. There was a spa on the 4th floor, but I did not have time to explore it on this trip. The bar upstairs on 21st floor was very busy and attractive with a fireplace and large sofa groups. The cocktails were very very good. Looking forward to returning in the summer so we can take advantage of the stunning rooftop bar! I could not have been happier with this hotel.

We had a king bed with enough space to store luggage, etc. The bathroom was spacious and beautiful. I'd be curious to see what a suite looks like in this place. But for a quick weekend stay, our room was perfect. The London House also has a lounge and restaurant on the 21st floor. We had a cocktail there, but no food. Unfortunately, we didn't get to check out the view because the place was super busy that night, but I heard from the staff that it is beautiful. Finally, the location was perfect. The view from the room was beautiful--especially when you look up-river, away from the Trump Tower.

Service was great, with the hotel messaging you upon check in and you have everything you need at your fingertips. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is for the food. Although they do have room service, their menu options are very limited. They have few options and in my opinion they should expand their in room dining menu to include more options.

We’ve been visiting Chicago for 20 years and have stayed in many of the downtown hotels.  LondonHouse has a superb location, but the entry they chose is unattractive, narrow, and busy with parking valets.  Next to this entrance, however, is a beautiful one with a lovely domed ceiling that leads you directly into the corridor with the elevators to the 2nd floor.  Checking in was fast, and staff were very efficient and pleasant.  After a bit of a learning curve with the elevators (you have to enter your floor # and then go to the indicated elevator A-H), my husband and I made it to our double Vista Room.  Note:  the beds are Full, not Queen.  The room is sleek and beautiful, but not as functional as it could be – why is there only one chair in a double room to enjoy the awesome view when there is enough space for a second one?  The color scheme is modern, the bedding is luxurious.  The room is not really large, but there wasn’t much in it to take up space.  For instance, there is no dresser with drawers so that you can unpack your suitcase.  There is only one nightstand with two 30” x 15” drawers.  We chose to move some of the artsy items that the hotel put in the bookshelves so we could use that space for hats, scarves, gloves and other foldable clothes.  The TV is huge and is the only thing on the largest wall.  The bathroom is gorgeous with trendy and heavy glass shower doors that I’m sure they will be adjusting weekly.  In fact, ours had a crack at the top from only 6 months use.  Also, the bathroom door to the room is frosted glass.  It does not close shut, only slides leaving a 2” gap, so it’s not as private as some may want.  Guess we are showing our age, but we would have preferred a Keurig to the Nespresso machine.  We had to make multiple trips to a nearby Dunkin’ Donuts.  Restaurants were close by and who could miss Trump Tower out the window!  We did not eat meals there, expensive.  We did go up to the rooftop on a sunny 27 degree day (brrr) and it was gorgeous view.  Would I stay here again?  For us, no.  But, I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend it to those wanting something beautiful and a little different.",5.0,,5.0,,5.0,,December 2016,Traveled as a couple,106,72.0

It has a fantastic location right at Michigan Avenue and the river with wonderful views from most of the rooms. The staff is great – friendly and helpful. The lobby bar is fabulous. Our rooms were both clean and comfortable, and we loved the mini fridge that allowed us to keep things cold. The coffee maker was nice to have; it would have been nice to have had some tea available as well. But – do hotel designers ever stay in their own “creations”? A few things would make the rooms much more comfortable. In a double room , there was only one bathrobe – do we have to share?! The tile floors in the bathroom were lovely, but very cold, especially in Chicago in the winter. An area rug would be nice. The rain shower head was very nice, but a lack of water pressure made it difficult for me to wash my long, thick hair. And there was only one towel hook – made it difficult when the two of us needed to hang 2 bath towels, 2 hand towels and 2 washcloths.  Lighting in the rooms was very dim. There was task lighting on the desk and reading spots bedside, but you couldn’t read in the chairs because it was too dark. And finally, the drawers under the bed were great for storage, but we kept stubbing our toes on them. Having them recessed a bit would be helpful.

We picked up a room at LondonHouse for a very reasonable rate, just under $100 per night (ex. taxes) and I assume this goes up quite a lot when the city is busy (and warmer). The location of the hotel is seemingly in the middle of everything, most of them within easy walking distance, even in December.Check in was simple and although we only had a standard room, it was plenty big enough for our needs and our view was fantastic.What we really liked about the hotel was; our view, the bed (very comfortable and very large), the Nespresso machine, the 55 inch TV (although we barely switched it on), the Bluetooth speaker and the hotel bar upstairs. The bar, although not particularly cheap had good service and some decent cocktails. The upper outside bar was (unsurprisingly) closed, although I still popped out for a look and it must be fantastic on a warm summer's evening.What we didn't like was; the walk-in shower which, although a decent size, didn't appear to have any temperature controls, only on or off. Very odd and not hot enough for either of us. The bathroom door was also a bit of a problem, because although it slides and looks great, there is still a large gap that means the room is not sound proof. Not a problem for one person, could be awkward when you are two, depending on how friendly you are. I also found the exterior noise a problem. Even though we were on the 7th floor, sirens in particular were very apparent in the early hours and the locals aren't afraid to use their horns either. As the hotel hasn't provided better glazing, ear plugs are required! As we were on a lazy couple of days and lounging in bed, we could also hear housekeeping in the hallway knocking on other doors.We didn't have breakfast, nor did we use the spa, so can not comment on either of those points.

We were there December 19-20, 2016.  It was frigid in Chicago.  Crowds were light, prices were low.As a Hilton Honors Gold Member, we were upgraded to a suite with a million dollar view of the bridges crossing the Chicago River.  The suite had tall ceilings and new furniture.  It was immaculately clean.  The bathroom was large.  We were given robes and slippers.We asked for very late checkout (5:00 p.m.) and got it.  We also got a free continental breakfast.  The service was friendly, the fruit was fresh, the croissants were so flaky we would have been on the Champs Elysees.We had a light lunch in the dining room.  Not cheap, but interesting, well-prepared dishes.The health club has plenty of equipment.  It might be a little on the small side during high season.  But I had plenty of room and easy access to the equipment.The location is unmatched in Chicago:  E. Wacker Dr. and N. Michigan Avenue.  There is easy access to corporate Chicago in the Loop, but the Mag Mile is just across the bridge.  There is easy access to the South Loop, home of one of our favorite inexpensive Chicago restaurants, Eleven City Diner.I loved the fact that you called for you elevator to take you to a specific floor.  No more pressing up then pressing your floor once you get in.   A small thing, but so brilliant you wonder why it is not a feature of every new hotel.Downsides?  Not many.  There is no closet.  Just a small hang bar which is jammed with hangers and the robes.  So there is no room to hang clothes.  There are no hooks on the doors, so you are really stuck.  We ended up laying our coats on the sofa in the small parlor area.  The suite is really one big room with a divider, the new trend.  But those are minor quibbles.

Location is perfect! Views from the vista rooms were nice and faced the Trump building so you're looking at the letters TRUMP.  The views from the Hyatt are better as you can see the Wrigley building and the river. We booked the King Vista suite and a connecting 2 double Vista room. I was highly disappointed with the suite. The sofa is a love seat and when the bed is expanded, it takes up the entire sitting area making it difficult to get to the bathroom. The sofa table needs to be moved to the bedroom to open the sofa bed and it's very heavy. The connecting door could not be kept open because there wasn't enough room to fit between the door and the wall. This room is extremely awkward and I would never recommend it. The 2 dbl. was spacious. They advertise a microwave in the room but, there wasn't one in either room. I expect a microwave and refrigerator when paying top rate for a suite. It was 11:00 pm when we realized there wasn't hot water in the double room. The maintenance person fixed it but we had to stay up until 1:30 while he worked on it. That was rough after a 5 hour drive to Chicago and then walking around town in the cold. There wasn't any bedding for the sofa bed so they had to bring that up to us as well. Housekeeping came in the next day, made the bed, locked the connecting door and left. Didn't leave towels, clean the bathroom or leave clean glasses. I finally complained and was told a manager would call me the next day. I'm still waiting for that call. I could go on but, it would make this review too long.

So if I can help one person have as as wonderful experience, it's worth writing. London House surpassed my expectations in all areas. Quality, refinement, and comfort echo though out this beautiful architectural gem. Staff could not be more accommodating and friendly. It was my daughter's 12th birthday and we flew there in hopes of getting last minute tickets to Hamilton- which I did at box office. The staff surprised my daughter with a beautiful dessert and card hoping she enjoyed her special Hamilton evening. The view of the river while enjoying a lovely nespresso in your room;  listening to the trivoli audio are the kind of details that creates a quality experience. The lounge on the second floor with a bar is a perfect place to enjoy everything from a cup of tea to dinner with drinks and fit any mood because of the various seating arrangements. I did not have a drink on the 21st floor lounge, but toured- again quality with a more Chicago night life feel. Treat yourself and stay at the London House- the specials make it a affordable option for many. Pay a little extra for the vista rooms with the floor to ceiling windows - worth it!",,,,,,,December 2016,Traveled with family,12,2.0

Great Location. Great Price Point.,"Our King “Vista” room on the 12th floor was spotless and beautifully appointed.  It was a bit smaller than we anticipated but adequate enough for a short stay.  The view from the floor to ceiling and wall to wall window of the Chicago River and surrounding architecturally historic buildings was EPIC.  Our bathroom was a decent size with a shower-only option.  Water pressure was OK but we encountered a bit of difficultly maintaining hot water throughout our stay.  Nice bath products and plenty of new fluffy towels.  The decor is mid-century modern and quite lovely.  Our bed was dreamy comfortable with great pillows and top-notch linens.  We had a Nespresso coffee maker as well as an empty mini-fridge; both convenient and much appreciated.  We were able to maintain the room temp perfectly even though we had huge windows and it was FREEZING cold outside. WiFi was good.  Set in a beautifully restored,1920’s high-rise building, you can tell this hotel is on the newer side as everything is fresh and not showing any signs of wear and tear.  We enjoyed the architectural detail and artwork throughout this beautiful old building.  Nice bar and Living Room type environment at lobby level. Every staff member we encountered were polite, welcoming and helpful.  The location is EXCELLENT and perfect for a downtown Chicago experience.  Michigan Ave is just steps away and is truly beautiful during Christmastime. SO many great restaurants and bars nearby.  Walgreens right around the corner.  We took the Blue Line to the Clark/Lake station from O’Hare and it was a 10 min walk to the hotel.  Not sure I would walk it again in the cold but not bad during decent weather.  The only odd thing we encountered were the elevators.  You must choose your floor from an iPad type device which will then tell you which elevator to use.  There are no floor buttons inside the elevator so be sure you get on the one designated specifically by you and for you.  We noticed other guests thought it was an odd concept as well; kind of funny actually...The LondonHouse is a lovely modern hotel with a great, convenient and scenic location. Very fair price point on our dates.  We travel to Chicago several times each year and have stayed in many wonderful hotels throughout the city.  Although a quick one night stay, we throughly enjoyed LondonHouse and would not hesitate to return.  Highly recommend!",,,5.0,4.0,,5.0,December 2016,Traveled as a couple,170,162.0

We went out for a walk and brunch to pass the time until the room was ready a few hours before standard check-in time. We stayed in a King Vista Room and the views are no joke as other people have reviewed.  My fiancé was blown away by the view and how modern and clean the hotel lobby and room was. We were there for two nights and on the second night we came back from dinner to complimentary champagne and chocolates in the room. This was not requested and apparently the engagement was overheard by lobby staff and was sent as a “congrats and thank you” for celebrating at the LondonHouse. I couldn't be happier with all the staff as they made us feel so welcome and special. Oh, they also checked in via text message just enough to be accommodating and make sure there was nothing else they could be doing to make our stay better. I thought that was awesome.

From the rooms, to the service, to the rooftop and room views... it was all amazing!The LondonHouse Hotel is in a great historic building right along the river in the heart of Chicago. You could not ask for a better location, as you are steps away from the theater district, Magnificent Mile, and Cloud Gate (the ""Bean""). It was cold (but not insanely cold) so we were able to walk everywhere we needed to go, even to the Fulton Market area. The Chicago's First Lady Architecture Cruise boards right across the street.The lobby is on the second floor and has a lovely, inviting lounge. Alexandra helped us when we arrived, and she made the check-in a breeze. As a Hilton Diamond member, she made sure to check for upgrades (we got a great view, see pics) and recommended a lot of things to do/see/eat in the area. I really liked that she remembered my name whenever she saw me the next few days, and I especially enjoyed the texting service. If I had not OCD-planned this trip in advance, I would have loved to use their Concierge service to score some restaurant/show tickets.We had a corner king room, Room 1x10, with an incredible view of the river. I wish I had taken pictures of the room, but it had a nice modern studio feel to it. The bed was so comfortable, and the fridge and Nespresso machine were a nice touch. As a Hilton Diamond member, I received 2 continental breakfast coupons per day. The coupons are used upstairs at the 20th floor restaurant. In lieu of the continental breakfast, you can also swap for $18 per person on the ala carte menu. I liked the lounge vibe of the restaurant, and the service was fantastic. Everyone in this hotel is so nice! We even got to go up to the rooftop bar, which was closed for service, but open for the views. Pretty cool up there!And really... how much did I enjoy this place?

Being an longtime HHonors elite, I always aim to try out new Hilton properties when I have a chance to do so. LondonHouse does not disappoint. A merging of new building combined with a total restoration of an existing, historical building flows seamlessly. The public spaces are best described as ""vintage meets West Elm"" -- stylish, complimentary to the vintage architecture, but very comfortable. Outside of the recent improvements to the Conrad brand, this is a concept that will help Hilton go after younger clientele who feel like Waldorf is for their grandparents.Don't be fooled by the narrow main entrance off of West Wacker - this is an expansive property. The shame is that the seemingly ""marquee"" way to enter at Michigan Ave./Wacker is locked (you can exit from there, though). On the second floor of LondonHouse is the main desk and lobby lounge. We had cocktails there the first night and found the seating areas to be enjoyable, but the service to be slow/unmotivated for a Friday evening. The space also has a fatal flaw during the winter: it is susceptible to the cold wind gusts that blow in from the entrance below. I'm someone who always ""runs warm"" and even I was a little uncomfortable. Hopefully, management will quickly install blowers or an air wall on the entry doors to help prevent this. This is the property's first winter, so I imagine they are just working through some initial, seasonal knicks. We reserved a ""Vista"" King Room online and were given one on the 7th floor. The view of the Chicago River was breathtaking and surprisingly, the outside noise was largely muffled thanks to heavily-glazed floor to ceiling windows. Only a random fire truck/ambulance could be heard when it was roaring at full-blast. The room itself was nicely-sized and well-designed. High-level trim was noted throughout, including premium fixtures and handles. The only complaint I would have is that the bathroom itself was rather small -- with a single sink and shower stall. It would have been fine for a business trip, but was too cramped for a couple trying to get ready simultaneously. The bed linens were comfy -- soft and warm -- with a mid-weight duvet. The pillows were king-size with down filling, but a little too flat for my tastes. Would have appreciated 2 firm/2 down pillows placed on the bed as a happy medium. Plugs and USB ports were throughout the room, including on both bedsides (always appreciated). The 55"" HDTV was the focal point from the bed and included Chromecast capability, which is such a simple, but welcomed innovation. To be able to watch a favorite Netflix show or YouTube video while traveling - without having to view it on my iPad or laptop - is a real treat! Outside of the small bathroom, the only other gripes I had with the guestroom experience was the free HHonors internet speed, which was <1mb/s the entire visit -- unacceptably slow for 2016 -- and an oddity with the entry door. Any time another guest on my side of the hall would close their door, our door would rattle in its frame. Annoying!Overall, you simply cannot beat LondonHouse's location for work or play. It's a solid addition at its price-point/class for the area and I'll definitely be back for another stay!",,,,,,,December 2016,Traveled as a couple,32,36.0

For a new hotel, the staff was excellent - very friendly and available to help.    The lobby bar was small and cozy, but very nice - with a duo performing Holiday Music.    Front desk staff was very efficient and welcoming.  I like the new touch of a text message asking about my stay vs the voice mail from the manager on the room phone.  I rarely touch a room phone, so it is nice to see this type of innovation.The 21st floor lounge/restaurant was very nice - and was accommodated to our ""after party"" group that found it's way there after our company event in the 3rd floor ballroom.   They kept their bar open and their staff available for at least an additional hour, and I'm pretty sure they had a very lucrative final hour.The location is excellent - the view from my room of the river was very nice also.   The room was small, but well organized and never felt cramped.   Bed was very comfortable as was the single chair in the room.I would easily recommend the LondonHouse to another traveler that wanted to stay in the heart of Chicago.My only regret is that it was too cold to enjoy their outdoor balcony.

The staff is also very friendly. But this is not a hotel for someone looking to stay 5 nights, especially if you have children with you. -Lighting or lack of lighting..the room was dark and figuring out the light switches to the one pendant hanging in the back of the room was daunting, especially in the dark. There are little lights near the bed and luckily the bathroom was well lit. It felt like they wanted the room dark in order to hide something..-Size..the room was very small. We even booked the larger double room with the view. Sardine box. -Room Service, sure sounds nice right? Especially when it's snowing and you have children and can't really go anywhere. Well think again, there is no where to eat any of the overpriced, mediocre food they offer. They don't bring a roll-in table and you have one very small desk to huddle over..in the dark. Also, there is not a single child sized option on the menu, not kid friendly at all. You are however, able to order food to be delivered from any of the restaurants in the area if you can't go out but good luck finding a place to eat in the room, unless you enjoy eating in your bed. -Linens, they are rough. The beds are dressed in a way that if you move in the wrong direction the cheap polyester-stuffed comforter becomes exposed showing you the blood stains hidden underneath. Who knows when those things were last washed..the pillow covers had blood stains as well. Lovely. -Thin walls, we could hear other guests and their TVs all night long...-Need a place to plug in the hair dryer? Don't look in the bathroom. Instead go to the mirror in the dark hallway, only outlet in the room besides the nightstand. If you like drying your hair in bed or the dark hallway, they've got you covered. -Lastly, if you need a place to hang your wet snow/rain covered coats, they will have to go in the closet with the rest of your dry clothes. Who would think you'd need a place to hang a wet coat in Chicago?Would not stay here again.",,,,,,,December 2016,Traveled with family,3,3.0

The room was spotless and very attractive with stylish details that were also functional.  Let's go down the list.  The king bed was extremely comfortable and the bedding was sumptuous.  Lovely sleeping.  There were many different lighting options - general room, sconces at each side of the bed, adjustable reading lights. A huge flat screen TV mounted on the wall - it had the ability to Chromecast from your phone, play music, etc.  The room's radio could also be used as a Bluetooth speaker.  The door to the bathroom was a huge, frosted, sliding glass partition.  And the motion of walking toward the bathroom, say in the middle of the night, would turn on the bathroom light ... so no fumbling around in the dark.  There was a rainfall shower head and the bathroom amenities were lush, from the bath towels, robe and slippers, to the soaps, large magnifying mirror, hair dryer.

The hotel was prepared to give me the room that I selected for on line check in.  I changed my mind when when we pulled up and I saw a possibility for rooms that looked north down Michigan.  The front desk agent cheerfully looked for one of these rooms.  The dining room staff was the same.  Everybody was friendly.  Service recovery was quick and friendly.

We live in the city and were excited to try out this new luxury Hilton property (we're honors members) for our wedding weekend in October. I arrived at 3:30pm, to a very long line and no one staffing the honors check in line. I had my wedding dress in town and was told my room wasn't ready. I had to leave my belongs including my dress with at the bell desk. I was very hesitant to do so, but I had to run to my rehearsal. My husband was texting with the hotel at this point since I was obviously very stressed over the situation. He asked (they didn't offer) to send up a bottle of wine to make up for the mistake. When I came back to the hotel for the night and asked for my things to be sent, I was told they'd be up in 15 minutes. Also, the bottle of wine was not waiting in the room like they said it would be, it arrived about 30 minutes later after I asked about it. At this point I'd been in the room for 45 minutes and my dress still wasn't there! I  finally called down asking where my $2,000 wedding dress was. They apologized and sent it up immediately, but I should not have been made to wait.We then when up to the rooftop bar for a drink before bed and while the views are amazing, the service was again awful. My wine glass was soapy and when I asked for a replacement, the bartender was snotty and did not even apologize for the mistake. Next morning, we went for breakfast (free for Honors members) and were shocked at the options. The only thing included were stale pastries, yogurt and the tiniest chopped fruit I've ever seen. Where's the protein? Every other Hilton property offers eggs, and meat. I went off to get married starving. Thanks LondonHouse.All in all, we splurged on this hotel to feel special on the most important day of our lives and were left feeling like we stayed at a Best Western. In fact, I've been treated better at some Best Westerns. The hotel itself is nice, but the rooms are quite small including our suite. For $400 a night, we expected a much grander experience.

I was in a corner king studio, which was spacious and comfortable, with lots of windows and a good workspace.  Complimentary wi-fi was reasonably fast and strong. The building, formerly an office building, is oddly shaped, and it appears that the rooms are too, but I think that's part of the charm. And the phenomenally thick exterior walls make this one of the quietest urban hotels I've ever stayed in.  I didn't sample the rooftop bar, but did have the continental breakfast buffet that came with my HHonors status.  It was not extensive, and would have been a bit pricey had I been paying for it, but what was there was good, the space was nice, and the servers pleasant.  My interaction with the staff was limited, except for the friendly and helpful doormen, but the encounters I did have were all pleasant.  This is definitely not a standard hotel, but it has the Hilton quality behind it and really gives you the feel of being in the heart of Chicago.  I loved it, and hope to stay here again.  Highly recommended.",,,,,,,November 2016,Traveled on business,47,64.0

We just looked for a fine rate and it had it. In the reviews we saw that it was close to everywhere, and we found out it is. That is all we needed. The service was perfect, even though you do not see many people if you do not want to. Front desk is on the second floor and you can move around freely. My room was not very big but it was enough. Our view was north; nice. West looks good too but I did not get to see it. We were at a walking distance of everything we wanted to see. And you have Nespresso coffee in the room. I would repeat a hotel like this one in any city. By the way I do not know how they made the picture you see here. The view from those rooms are to Trump tower across from the river.

Beds were the most comfortable I've ever stayed in.  The staff were pleasant including all room cleaning staff.  The rooms were absolutely spotless including the glass shower screen which is usually impossible to get looking brand new. We unfortunately had a dirty bed quilt discovered on waking the next day though.  This took a couple of attempts to have rectified but the receptionist immediately offered us a small discount on our stay which was a swift and fair resolution.  I would say that for the room price the entrance to the hotel isn't very impressive if that matters to you.  The main reception is at first (second in american) floor level so you can enter a small lobby and go to the lifts and your room without ever really getting that wow feeling of entering an impressive lobby space.

Concept has potential, execution is a bit off.","From a hundred feet away, this hotel is intriguing. Especially at night. The hybrid structure is a well scrubbed, repurposed former office building from the 1920s connected to a 21st century glass box. As you enter the hotel it seems like little thought was given to how a customer would experience a first impression of what the Hilton Corporation wants to say is a luxury property. It looks bland, and unfinished. I could have walked into an office building, an apartment building, or into a corridor that would lead me to some other place. The entrance of a luxury hotel should be high on brand message and something memorable. A leader of the firm obviously felt that was unnecessary. That's a shame.A friendly and super professional member of staff greeted me and escorted me to the elevator. I exited at the lobby to check-in which is on the second floor. It is high on quirkiness. Mostly executed successfully. Some items were just strange seemingly for the sake of being strange. I found the rooms to be comfortable and quiet. The bed super comfy. I loved the Nespresso branded coffee maker in the room and the high quality clock radio with a bluetooth connection that will allow you to listen to your choice of tunes in hi-fi. There is a translucent glass sliding door to the bathroom that could be problematic for travellers lodging with a partner. The materials, finishes, and colours used in the hallways and rooms feel modern and calming with a masculine slant. The gym is a joke. The size of the room would be no surprise for a motel built in the 60s that wants to appeal to a ""health and wellness trend"" but is not acceptable for whom it seems like this brand wants to appeal to. There is little equipment, no proper place to stretch, a few treadmills, and pretty much nothing else. It is clean, it does look like someone gave thought to how it looks, but no thought on functionality or usability.If you want grab a cup of coffee or tea in the lobby before you head out to work or a business function, you're out of luck. The hotel will direct you to a café in the lobby that is crowded with folks exiting tour buses. Breakfast in the hotel I tried once and only once. It was slow, and seemingly geared towards those who are happy with a buffet. Ordering a-la-carte took too long and there was just too little food for what I paid. One night I ventured up to the roof bar. If you are content being around self-centered, loud folks whose vocabulary highly favours the word ""like"", love to take selfies, and stare at their devices to see who posted what on Facebook or Instagram, you will love being there. I left after five seconds.Chicago has great hotels. London House misses the mark in too many places for me to seriously consider returning. Perhaps the moment will come when it feels customer focused. I left feeling like it checked the boxes for the executives of the firm who signed off on moving forward with the capital expense but failed to look at any of it from a user perspective.",,,4.0,,5.0,5.0,October 2016,Traveled on business,62,99.0

Immediately we told her it was not what we ordered, she was not even aware that tequila Anejo has a yellow colour and probably she thought we weren't either! Her answer was that they didn't have that one that's why she replaced it. We refused it and received another tequila, still not sure that was not a reposato as the light yellow colour was not really corresponding with what we wanted.

Great location. On the side of river, you can see the beautiful city just from the window in your room. The building is also a popular sightseeing spot for tourists, so remember that there may be a lot of people in the elevator with you but only you going for check-in.2. Continental breakfast is OK, but do not expect that is going to make you full and fresh in the morning. As a diamond member of HHonors, I feel totally fine since the breakfast is free after all. But, it is not worth $18 if you'd like to pay for it.3. I stumbled upon two tiny little cockroaches walking on the wall of my shower room and the wall next to the mirror. You can see them from my pictures. I killed one but another was moving so fast. I believe every hotel might have these kind of problems, so I chose not to report it. I also believe that I was just so unlucky.4. The personnel ARE NOT OK.(1)I checked-in through Hilton app on the day before arrival and picked the room 2031. When I was checking-in at the hotel, 4PM, the room was not ready for me. The male staff offered me another room of 1629, saying that the view is exactly the same. I accepted it because I was tired and needed to take a shower immediately and went for the ball game. However, the truth is: the room 1629 is much smaller than 2031. (He did not mention it.) I was very unlucky.  By the way, the staff did not say anything like “You are a diamond member and we have tried our best to upgrade your room,” which is weird, because I used to stay in IHG/IC hotels and they have these kind of “formal notice.” I did not mention that, but he seemed totally not aware of it either. Perhaps their procedure is just to ignore your status if you do not beg for an upgrade. (Even if you are not willing to upgrade my room, you can simply lie to me that the rooms are full today. I would believe you.) Or, their system is not not connected to Hilton?(2)Restaurant for breakfast: I showed up at 8 AM at the restaurant and there were already three people waiting in line. At the first place, I thought the restaurant was filled with people, but in fact I was wrong. That was just because the waiters were not enough to take care of every customer. I was brought to a table, where one of the seats was packed with somebody else’s luggage. The waiter (the madam standing at the entrance brought me to that seat) did not even move those stuff away. What’s worse, there is no napkin, fork, or spoon on MY table. (There were utensils on any other tables.) Maybe they just do not have time to prepare it for me.(3)Check-out: As usual, lots of people. You must wait in line. And, this time, a guy in front of me might have some issues regarding his stay, so the madam at the desk was (a little?) upset. Unfortunately, she treated me like she did to that man. She used her single hand to wave to notify me to move forward. I was about to tell her that the fact that I saw live creatures in my room yesterday, but, unfortunately again, she did not even ask me how my stay was. As a result, I chose to report it here.5. I guess that the only well functioning personnel in this hotel is the madam who talked with me through “texting”. I asked for a toothbrush kit and she delivered it to my room immediately. Remember, there is no dental kit in the room.This was my first time staying in a Hilton brand hotel. I just got the diamond member status a few month ago because the airlines that I am affiliated with offered me a “matching.” So, maybe this hotel does not care a diamond member with no stay records, or it just does not have enough time to take care of him because they have tens of thousands of diamond members through “matching”.Overall, I would have stayed in Holiday Inn Express for a night over 200 dollars. Without expectation, there is no disappointment.",,5.0,1.0,3.0,,,October 2016,Traveled solo,29,5.0

I live near Chicago but decided to stay downtown for Architecture Weekend, and since the Hilton London House was on the tour and a recently renovated historic property I decided to stay there.  I used my Hilton Honor points to upgrade to a Vista Suite, but a few months later a good friend warned me that they had thought they were staying in the historic London Guarantee & Accident Building (completed 1923) but ended up staying in modern glass skyscraper that they built a couple of years ago.  I called Hilton and they had no idea what I was talking about and they told me to call the hotel.  I got someone the next day who confirmed I was in the George Jetson office building and not the historic property.  They told me it was more desirable because of the better view and they were effectively the same otherwise.  I was skeptical of this but my sense of it after staying there is the room interiors /decor are very similar and the view from the enormous glass windows is indeed better.  Nonetheless the website trumpets the “historic” property so I was quite surprised to be upgraded OFF the historic property which was the reason I booked the room to begin with.  While I don’t think I suffered real harm I do feel the website is a bait-and-switch. The room was nicely decorated in a sort of modern take on old world elegance — dark wood, stainless steel fixtures.  Walking shower, large bathroom, well lit.  The view of Trump Tower and the Chicago River was stunning and the highlight of the room.  Nice TV but to be honest if you turn on a television in a room with a view like this I have nothing to say you.  The view of the Chicago river, with the tour boats and incredible buildings and kayakers and street activity is beyond breathtaking.  Did I mention the view?  Let's mention it again.  It was spectacular.The room had some nice features, like really nice toiletries and a button that turned all the lights on and off with one press, and not so nice features like an elegant sliding door armoire that would have been more elegant if it was on the track and a pen on the desk that was out of ink.  The concierge (Shannon?) and the front desk clerks were wonderful:  cheerful, efficient, and perky.  They got 5 stars.  When I went up to the restaurant at 10:15 PM on Saturday night they were still serving, sort of, but there was no hostess and when I wandered around for a while asking someone eventually showed me to a table.  To be honest there were a bunch of people in black T-shirts wandering around and I wasn’t at all sure who was working and who was hanging out.  The waitress was working but there appeared to be no management presence at all.   After 10 minutes I gave up hope of being served and went up to look at the rooftop bar.  Crowded, but the views were stunning.  So the views were incredible, the service non-existent.Then I caught a cab to a restaurant that had a manager.  Disappointing.They were having a wedding that night and they were playing SHOUT! until 1AM loud enough for me to sing and dance along, but I was up anyway and it didn’t bother me.  I’m mentioning it because noise might be a problem if you want to turn in before the party ends at 1AM.  Personally, I don’t really expect them to turn off Chicago at 10PM on Saturday night, but I know this might be a problem for some people.  The next morning the check out staff was (again) amazing.  I checked my bags and continued my architecture tour.   When I came back about 3:45 PM (hoping to catch a 4:30 train) the bell staff had vanished.  After about 5 minutes I went and hunted down someone, who sent someone else, who then couldn’t find my bag, and then brought the wrong bag, then complained the bag was left in the wrong room.  The problem was corrected and the bellman was very nice, but when you’re trying to catch a train you don’t want to play baggage-hide-and-go-seek.  There were several people in line behind me waiting endlessly as well.   Not good.So overall service gets a “C” which is an average of an A+ and a “F”.  Wifi service in the lobby was a problem which was a nuisance before and after checkout when I couldn’t get e-mail. Hilton has an uncontrollable lust to charge you $9.95 for a service that should be free with a $300 hotel room.   If the Corner Bakery downstairs wasn’t mobbed I would have gotten my e-mail for free.  However although I eventually established room connectivity the lobby was a lost cause and I decided not to spend the afternoon playing tech support (hey, you need time to get your bags!)Elevators have the keypads where you enter the numbers and then it tells you what floor to go to.  I’ve seen this before at HUGE hotels (Marriot Marquis, Time Square) but it works better when the elevators are much more clearly marked and there is someone on staff there to explain the system to the puzzled grandmother who has no idea how to use a touch screen.  It’s hard to tell the “A” elevator from the “B” elevator because of the historic decor and training people in how to use the elevators quickly became my part time job.  Even with the programming system the elevators seemed to be using the same mechanism as 1923, which gave me lots of time to admire the renovation.   The confusion of the keypads only made it worse.I was VERY glad the property was on the Chicago Architecture Foundation’s Open House as that is what drew me to the property and it was good to get a little tour.  Five stars for that!  THANK YOU!! In summary, the hotel is excellent in many ways, but lacking in many others, and every WOW moment had a ????? to match it.  Give that there are probably 75 awesome hotels within a mile of the London House, I can say I’m glad I experienced it once but I will not be rushing back anytime soon.",2.0,5.0,3.0,,,,October 2016,Traveled solo,99,79.0

The award goes to....CRUZ! The reason I started with this is because it's not often you can pinpoint someone on staff who literally made your night. But in this case, that's exactly what happened.I lived in Chicago for almost 15 years and recently moved away. This was my first time back. Selecting a hotel was not an easy task. At one point I had 4 different reservations. Because of cost, location, and reviews, I finally went with LondonHouse. I'll start from the beginning. First of all, it's very easy to walk to from the Blue Line. I know how insane the city can be, so this was important to me. If I can avoid cabs, I win! Check in was super easy and it gave me time to take in the lobby, where I knew i would most likely be having a cocktail in the near future. The man who checked me in was very polite when I requested a quiet room. It was the first time a way from my 9 month old and SLEEP was on my agenda. He put me at the very end of the hall on the 13th floor. I barely heard a thing. (They also check in with you via text a few times throughout your stay to make sure you're happy. I consider this ballsy as it's very easy to complain when you don't have to use your face and mouth.)I will say, when I walked into my room for the first time, the size of it was underwhelming. Felt a little claustrophobic, but when I saw how big the bathroom was and realized you could spin the TV to face either way, whether you're in bed or the office area, it felt a little more open. And that view of the river will fix just about anything. I went out for the night and then returned to the hotel and had a nightcap in the lobby bar. Very friendly, welcoming...and yes, expensive. Well, at least the price of a whiskey on the rocks kept me from having another one. I got a massage the next morning. I am extremely picky about massages. Like, I get irate when a masseuse is too gentle. Waste of money. The masseuse at LH was heavenly. Perfect amount of pressure and she couldn't have been sweeter. My plan for the evening was to hang with my best friend on the rooftop. This time is especially important to us now that I no longer live 5 minutes away from her. We made our way up there around 7 pm. We cringed when we saw how busy it was, but asked Cruz, the guy at the host stand, if there was a way to reserve a seat. When he said there wasn't, we were ready to figure out a plan B. As two women in their late 30's, it's not the first time a guy at a host stand would foil our plan for the night. But wait -- Cruz was not going to let that happen. As we stood, awkwardly, trying to figure out what to do next, he ran over to us and pointed out one seat next to the fire. ""One of you sit there, I saw another open chair that I'll bring over."" And that, friends, is how Cruz made our night. Two chairs, best spot on the whole rooftop. Not to mention the fact that he helped get us drinks at the overly crowded bar. In all my years of living in Chicago, rarely have I seen this kind of customer service. He truly wanted to make sure we had an amazing night. And we did, mostly because of him. My only semi-critism (other than size of room) is the room service menu. I miss Chicago food. Really REALLY miss it. The menu isn't terrible, but it's not great either. I'd probably skip it next time and order in from somewhere else so I can still eat dinner in bed:)All in all, I had a wonderful experience from the moment I walked into the door until the time I left. I will definitely return in the future.",4.0,,5.0,,,5.0,October 2016,Traveled solo,14,19.0

I'm giving the hotel 4 stars instead of 5 due to the following hiccups. 1. I was first put in a beautiful corner room that I immediately was impressed with but realized it didn't work for me because it was on the 4th floor. I'm a fairly light sleeper and the noise from being on a floor so close to the street was just too much. I honestly felt I was practically outside the hotel. I asked the hotel for a new room and they relocated me to the same corner room on the 13th floor the next day, which was much better! If you're a heavy sleeper the noise may not bother you but if you are or just want a more quiet room, ask for a higher level floor.2. I wasn't able to connect to wifi from any of my devices the night I checked in, which was a problem because I needed to access my corporate email to get some work done but couldn't. After trouble shooting with hotel wifi tech support for a while it was determined the problem was with the wifi router on the 4th floor. Regardless of what the manager on duty tried (and I could tell he was really trying to resolve this issue for me) including rebooting the router, nothing helped. I had to finally resort to using my phones hot spot which was a terribly slow connection for accessing my company's email system and network. Before I was moved to my new room, Mike the manager, made sure the wifi access was working perfectly in that room so I wouldn't have anymore connectivity issues. Thank you Mike!!3. The room safe needed a new battery, which isn't a big deal at all but I had to wait for almost 45 minutes to have an engineer come to my room to replace it. Normally that wouldn't be that big a deal but I needed to leave for a meeting and the 45 minute wait made me 10 minutes late to my meeting.4. The little refrigerator wasn't working properly so the engineer replaced the unit rather than trying to fix it, to be on the safe side  5. The rooftop bar didn't serve any desserts or hot drinks (coffee or cappuccino). It would have been nice to enjoy the beautiful rooftop setting and views with something other than a cold drink and appetizers. Maybe they'll add those options in the future.There's no question that when I return to Chicago I'll definitely stay here again. Every staff member made me feel appreciated and for me that's the key to having a great experience at a high end hotel!  Thanks LondonHouse!",,,,,,,October 2016,Traveled on business,17,20.0

Very nice hotel and finish throughout is of a high standard. Great central location as central as you can get. One criticism would be the lobby situation - it's shared with the quite popular bar on the roof and presumably other offices. It's a bit chaotic and comprises of essentially a corridor and some elevators with lots of people standing around. I arrived late at night and there was no one there to point out to me (with two cases) that the hotel reception is on the first floor.

I even tried the rollaway, and it was firm and supportive as well.  The room was super clean and I really like that they had an empty fridge in the room for drinks we purchased.  Toiletries are by Malin and Goetz, so you cannot go wrong.  Service is where the London House truly stood out.  I cannot say enough times how awesome Jessie at the front desk was.  There was a last minute addition to our party, and Jessie went way out and beyond to accommodate us with a suite.  Every time we ran into her in the lobby, she always asked about our stay.

Check in was a breeze. The front desk asked if we wanted to upgrade to a room with a view for an extra $20 a night. We declined and I'm glad we did. Our room did have a view, just only from the bathroom. But we didn't care. It was a nice view of the river. The room itself was a bit cramped but adequate. The big divider in the room was what made it a bit tight. But let's be real, we didn't spend that much time in the room and we weren't in town for that long. At first it didn't seem as if there were any dresser drawers in the room but we soon discovered the bed was a storage bed with drawers. The bathroom was very nice and roomy and well lit. Our room was on the 17th floor above Michigan and Wacker.  So we did hear a lot of street noise but sometimes you just can't escape the noise when staying in the city.During our stay we decided to try out their room service. This is an area where they need major improvement in. Our first morning I called to place an order but kept getting voicemail.  I left a message but call back.  Finally after 30 min I called the front desk. They placed the order. I went with coffee and oatmeal.  The oatmeal was lukewarm to the point I couldn't eat it.  And I only got a cup of coffee, not even a small pot.  Usually when ordering coffee a small pot is provided.  We decided to give room svc another chance. This time dinner. We ordered 2 entrees, one being a grilled chicken sandwich.  What I received was a chicken salad sandwich. Gross. No where on the menu is a chicken salad sandwich.

And, boy-oh-boy are we glad we did. Don't hesitate to give this new hotel a try. We'll be coming back for sure.PROS: LOCATION: Right on the river. Right on the corner of Wacker and Michigan. A perfect location for tourists and those with business in the Loop, North Bridge, or Michigan Avenue area. ROOM AMENITIES: The bed was Hilton plush. The linens very, very nice. The lighting is a bit unusual. You'll have to get used to operating it. If a bellman takes you to the room, have him show you how the lights work. The bathroom was roomy and the shower excellent. Toiletries were first class. Towels were large and plush. Very nice. ROOM COMFORT AND SIZE: Other reviewers complained about small room. For Chicago standards we found the room roomy and well appointed. NOISE: Other reviewers complained about noisy rooms. No us. We were on the 12th floor facing the river and had little to no noise infiltration. But, ever if we did, you can set the room AM fan to HIGH and have all of the white noise you would need. SERVICE: We found the service, from the front door, to the front desk, to the concierge, to the guest services staff to be excellent and very attentive. Earlier reviewers found problems with service. That appears to be fixed. ELEVATORS: Modern and very fast. You program the floor to which you're headed, the computer panel directs you to one of 6 elevators, and before you know it your at your floor. We never waited more than 30 seconds for an elevator. ROOF TOP BAR: A lovely place to visit, especially if the weather is fine. We found the prices average for Chicago, especially given the view. CURTAINS: The black out curtains in our room were 95-98% dark. Very good. CORNER BAKERY: There is an entrance to the Corner Bakery from inside the hotel, just by the elevator. It was a great way to get economical morning breakfast and coffee for our room.CONS: We really had no complaints other than access to newspapers. At least during our stay, they ran out of papers very early. A couple of days we didn't get a paper which was disappointing. Nevertheless, we were delighted with the hotel, our room, and the wonderful service.

While the fit and finish was certainly up to par, with quality beds and linens, the service levels and amenities were sorely lacking. First let me say I accept that despite their marketing, The Curio Collection of hotels is a step down from Hilton's top luxury brands, The Waldorf and The Conrad. I can accept that their 1 Bedroom suite lacks a bathtub, that it only came with one robe or the complete lack of a minibar. I can even accept the incredible limited room service menu that stops serving at 10pm, leaving the wary late night arrival with no viable options for a snack.But I cannot accept a so called luxury hotel that does not serve a hot breakfast. The entire breakfast experience was a poorly executed fiasco. To start, there is a digital display board in each elevator informing guests that breakfast is served on the 21st floor. Upon reaching the 21st floor, you are told it is closed for a special event all week and to go down to the second floor. When I asked why they don't modify the digital display in every elevator when they are having a special event, let alone notify their customers when booking that their restaurant is closed for THE WEEK, the person on the 21st floor stares back impassively, seemingly incapable of a verbal response. So we proceed down to the 2nd floor where we find out that due to the special event, it is a cold continental breakfast only. Incredulous, we ask is there no way to get a hot breakfast all week, and are told only thru room service. So we ask if we can sit in the restaurant and order our hot breakfast though room service and are told no. Ready to scream, we return to our room to order room service and are told we can only get hot coffee drinks ourselves on the second floor, they will not deliver them. Game over.So to surmise, you can either sit on the second floor eating a cold breakfast with hot coffee, or you can sit in your room eating a limited selection of hot breakfasts with no coffee. This is the kind of blatant and needless stupidity that drives a professional traveler nuts. If LondonHouse wants to call themselves a luxury boutique, they need to greatly improve their restaurant and room service offering.",,,,,,,October 2016,Traveled as a couple,57,60.0

On both occasions, I've used Hilton's Digital Key technology - it worked flawlessly both times. I appreciate the numerous outlets both by the desk and the bed; very helpful for charging multiple electronic devices without having to go outlet hunting. The bed was quite comfortable, especially considering how new it was (I expected it to be rock hard). I also like how they used the contours of the building to carve out unique rooms. They aren't all boring rectangles like most hotels. In one room, the wall-mounted TV formed a divide between the 'bedroom' and the work area of the room, making it seem more like a suite. The views from the bar and restaurant on the top floor is fabulous; although it was a little crowded given the good weather, it was still worth it. My only qualm is that the hotel didn't provide a paper copy of the bill under the door on my final night's stay.

This newer property does a great job emphasizing more old school sophistication and keeping the hipster shiny-object fluff to a minimum.

I could not tell if it was midnight or 8 am.  Also, the air conditioner was nearly inaudible.  As expected, the bed was great.  If you can't get well rested here, seek medical attention.2)  The bed sits on a platform that extends beyond the mattress.  Watch those toes!3)  Great river views out of the north side.4)  Bizarre elevator system.  You enter your destination floor on a touch screen and are assigned an elevator car via onscreen message; i.e., enter ""17"" for floor 17, then read ""Please use car A"" or whatever.  Don't just get into the first open elevator door or you'll be back on the ground floor trying it again.5)  When the rooftop bar is closed, visit the ""On21"" bar coincidentally located on floor 21.

Saturday morning was an attempt at a menu, with a weak continental breakfast running $18, and a cup of coffee running you $6 (HHonors voucher covering $18).  The service was...well, there was no service because our server quit before bringing us anything.  The beverage manager did his best to help us, and that was appreciated because the restaurant manager was overwhelmed by the situation.  Sunday, we found the menu had been abandoned (per our server, the previous day was a ""hot mess""), so we got a continental breakfast, coffee, and eggs for our voucher.  Monday morning, breakfast was on 2 instead of 21, with only continental breakfast available.  Doesn't Hilton have a template they can use?  4 months in, we didn't expect so much chaos on something so simple.  The Hampton Inn has a better breakfast than anything we saw during our stay.As for the room itself, the Jr. Suite, it was what you would expect for the price.  There was a Nespresso with 3 capsules.  For a suite, I would have liked to see 2 chairs/robes/towel hooks, though.  It seemed to cater to a single traveler.  Housekeeping was on their game, as the room was clean and inviting each day.This place wants to be exclusive, but if you can't figure out the service on the basics, it's not going to work.",,,,,,,October 2016,Traveled as a couple,109,53.0

I decided to surprise her with the hotel. After much research about hotels in the Michigan Ave. area I decided on this hotel. It had a great view, with the Vista Suite I booked. Among the best in the city, overlooking the river, and with a great skyline view. It's also very close to everything we wanted to do.Upon arrival, admittedly early, I was told the room wasn't ready yet but that a request to prepare it quickly would be made. An hour and 15 minutes later the room still wasn't ready. Of course I was annoyed, especially since I had been told the hotel was not sold out. If it had been my hotel and I knew a customer was waiting I probably would have immediately gone to prepare that room first, but that's just me.The suite was small, about 60 ft. larger than a vista room. I knew that when I booked but I still would have preferred a larger room. The view was great, as promised. Unfortunately, that didnot make up for the the fact that the flowers I had ordered for my wife's birthday were not in the room as I requested. When I complained the hotel sent up complimentary champagne and chocolate-covered strawberrys. Nice, but not what I requested.Additionally, sound travels very well through the hotel. We were there on  a weekend and heard music from the weddings hosted below both nights. Not a huge deal but evident even though we were 16 floors up. The other thing which was evident is that wherever the kitchen is-there really is not much of a restaurant on the premises-the smell of  grilling food permeated our room. I know this could sound good to some people and was okay for about the first hour, but after that it was annoying.Overall the weekend was great, despite the few problems that arose but I think I'll choose a different hotel next time",3.0,5.0,3.0,,,,October 2016,Traveled as a couple,1,

We had to ask four times for salt and pepper. Food came out cold and would forget things like sausage or something that was supposed to come with it. I know I shouldn't complain about a comped breakfast, but we did pay to upgrade to the warm breakfast and it was a waste of money. We went back the second morning and just had the complimentary fruit, bread and yogurt and none of the wait staff came to ask if we wanted eggs or coffee for thirty minutes.  A couple next to us was shocked when they were charged $18.00 for such a small selection of food.

Equally Abel on front desk who did his best to accommodate our early arrival at 3pm for a 4pm check in, and noticed our honeymoon which was rewarded with a complimentary glass of champagne.However, that was where the customer service stopped even as a diamond member of HHonors. An hour later a room was available, but no help with luggage or being shown to room which other guests seemed to get.Rooms are functional but not practical. We were in a vista suite, but embassy suites do better for room size. Best of knowledge would say that every room has shower only and they are warm at best.Customer service quite honestly sucks. You literally have to ask and chase for everything and have to say that whether or not you had HHonors status they really didn't care.The showcase is the 22nd floor outside bar. However, be warned if you want a table there is a $50 minimum per person and you have to prebook, seriously?!Continental breakfast is available which if you are gold or diamond is free but again service is lacklustre, every day it took at least 20 minutes for a latte! The hotel has a great location but they really need to refocus on customer service and realise that the customer is king, which right now they don't.

Everything was perfect. One suggestion from the front desk was the rooftop bar on the 22nd floor. We decided to check it out upon arrival and were bummed to see it closed until noon. We came back and the views and service beyond made up for the bar being closed when we originally wanted to go. We were promptly greeted by Tim, who made us feel welcome with his quick and witty banter (apparently he's a standup comic in the city, it showed). He went over the drinks and suggested his favorites, which we took him up on. I had an old fashioned, and my wife had the Roaring Twenties. Both were amazing. The Old Fashioned had to have been one of the best I've had in a long time. We had duck fat fries, as well as some sort of cheese bread and a basic salad. All of them were amazing, and are great for sharing.The bill was what you'd expect for a downtown rooftop (we're from NYC, so it was actually less than expected), running around 100 for a few drinks each and the food. Our afternoon at the rooftop at London House will be something we remember for years to come, and will suggest all of our local family visits. If only Chicago's unpredictable weather didn't cut our visit short, as it started raining shortly after we finished our food. Overall, our experience at London House was amazing.

Valet gave a special tip to us: parking is $71 overnight, but download SpotHero and pay $40, which we did. Thank you!  Bags brought to room, room was clean and like new. Small but furnished nicely. My wife ordered room service when I went to meeting and it took only 6 minutes.  Perfect. We had our meetings in one of there meeting rooms and my wife stayed in the room, and then requested a late check out, given that I was presenting and finished at 3:30. This was a Wednesday. They said they would charge $100 per hour for a later check out. So she said she would wait in lobby (on second floor) and dragged both of our bags down. Upon checkout, the front desk clerk said that my wife could store our luggage while she waited for me. HOWEVER, she would need to haul the luggage downstairs on her own to the bellman. My wife has fibromyalgia and a degenerative spine disease, but that did not matter to this clerk. So my wife sat near the front desk for two hours, until I saw my text and could excuse myself to help her. They were not short staffed, bellman waiting in a huddle on the first floor, but front desk would not ask for help. And this is the service for a family with a group that booked a block of rooms and a private event room. Very disappointing. We wont be booking our firm's holiday party here either (my wife was there to look at rooms) because of this experience upon departure.

Chicago is a halfway point between my mother and I, so we met here for the weekend. I was able to check in early upon arrival with a beautiful river view facing trump tower, a few floors down from the room I chose on my HHonors app. This was fine with me as I had checked in nearly 4 hours early. Valet went smoothly with my mothers vehicle. Hotel interior is beautiful. We visited the rooftop bar around 1pm for mimosas (although they were pricey) you couldn't beat the view and at that time of day the roof was empty. We also visited after dinner (around 11pm) and were able to skip the line as hotel guests. It was very young and hip and even had a fire in the corner as it got chilly at night. Our room was gorgeous and modern. I felt extremely comfortable at this hotel from my room to amenities at the hotel to their customer service.

Because although on the 18 th floor the windows are not sound proof and 2. you can hear EVERYTHING even the street traffic. I don't think the fire engines ever get cut off. The vent over the door cuts on and off every 3 minutes or so and sounds like a vacuum cleaner is being run when the room is finally quiet. So now you have to fight through that noise. Then around midnight there was some party or something going on above us. I called the front desk who said security would check it out. The noise still didn't stop until about 3:30am two hours after I called  and no follow up call either. The next day Sunday I went to the front desk and was told it was a Trump protest. I said playing music? There was no talking just music vibrating through our room on the 18th floor. I asked if we moved would it be more quiet or all the rooms not sound proof? She didn't know. So, basically all the rooms are equally noisy. No need to move if the noise can still be heard from the streets. So, we kept our room. Because we were up all night, we slept most of the day. We left the room and requested the room be cleaned around 5. We came back to our room about 10:30 the room hadn't been touched. I called customer service who said she would leave a message for the house keeping supervisor. Nothing happened and still no one came. We didn't even bother on Monday, since we were leaving at 3am to catch an early flight. Overall aesthetically it's a nice hotel but pretty busy and noisy on the first floor and that may be due to the popular rooftop and restaurant. I just expected a better level of service and we didn't get it.  I like to think of my room as an escape from the Hustle and bustle but no such luck, this go around. The level of noise and service is not worth it. Especially with so many other options at a fraction of the cost and better noise quality and service.",,,,,,,September 2016,Traveled on business,2,3.0

I got an excellent price.  Arriving I was welcomed as a Gold member, but did not receive my two bottles of water (I forgot to remind the staff).  I did, however, receive my complimentary breakfast coupons.  We got a room overlooking Chicago river.  It was a luxurious, but tiny room - basically enough room for the king sized bed, one chair and a little desk.  The air conditioner was soooo quiet.  The TV was gigantic and the bathroom was lovely.  The complimentary bath products were wonderful.  The bed was so comfortable and didn't have any lumps in it.  The breakfast was outstanding.  Made-to-order omelettes, chocolate croissants, fruit, fresh squeezed juices and strong coffee.  The location is close to many parts of Chicago and you can just walk to many places, however, Wrigley Field may be a bit too far.  The hotel is very close to the elevated train, so you can come directly from the airport and not get a car (parking is $71/night at the hotel!).  The front desk was a bit off-putting.  When I went to retrieve my water, they wanted to first verify I was a Gold HHONORS member.  I understand others may not be eligible, but it's two bottles of water!  I recommend the front desk rethink having the guests prove they are GOLD - at least until they remember to give the water out at check-in.  The staff in the breakfast area was outstanding.  Personable, efficient, and willing to get you items even though it was self-serve.  I do, however, recommend that a process be put in place to retrieve the complimentary breakfast coupons.  One server would take them and others would ask for them.  They always believed us that we have given them to someone else, but this happened every morning, so it is something to improve in.I don't normally stay in luxury hotels.  I now see the difference.  The only thing that would have made it perfect is if we had gotten an upgrade to something slightly larger.

The hotel is located in the business district at the corner of Wacker Dr. and Michigan Ave., which makes it ideal for walking along the riverfront, catching a show at The Chicago Theatre, or exploring the Magnificent Mile on foot.The hotel offers valet service for around $72, but you could park in a nearby public parking garage for around $56. When you enter the hotel you must go up the elevator or flight of stairs to the check-in counter. The reception area is beautiful and brand new, and the staff is incredibly friendly and helpful. The lobby offers plenty of seating and a full bar with floor to ceiling windows overlooking the Chicago River. This allows for a lot of natural light. My room was on the 8th floor facing south, so I lacked the nice view of the river. Like every room in the hotel, it was a non-smoking room, and included free WiFi, a flat screen TV, and spacious workstation. It lacked a spacious closet. The room also had a mini-fridge and safe. My room in particular had a very comfortable king size bed and nightstand with a cool, retro looking alarm clock. The bathroom had a large, full-length mirror, which was great for getting ready for work. The bathroom also had a stand-up glass shower and vanity mirror, complimentary towels, toiletries, and hair dryer. The hotel has a 24-hour fitness center, spa, meeting rooms, a grand ballroom, and a one-of-a-kind rooftop terrace and bar with great food and pricey cocktails ($20 for a mixed drink). It can get crowded, but show your keycard, and you won't have to wait togain access to the rooftop. People do dress up when going to this bar in the evening. Everything is relatively close. Walk across the street to the Chicago River, where you can hop on a boat tour or walk the riverfront to Navy Pier. Walk Michigan Ave. north to the Magnificent Mile for all of the hottest shopping. Take an Uber south to the Shedd Aquarium, the Field Museum, and Soldier Field. It's all at your fingertips from this hotel.",,,5.0,,5.0,5.0,August 2016,Traveled on business,91,11.0

The gentlemen behind the counter said  they would give us a call when the room was ready. When they called, however, he had some bad news for me. Our room was having some issues with power and they needed to move us rooms. We had booked a Vista room with views of the river, but since none were available they put us in a suite on the other side of the building and comped us for part of the night's stay, which I thought was fair. The next day we packed our bags up and went out for the day. When we got back they had moved us into a real nice Vista suite. I thought they handled that situation really well and we were both happy with the outcome. The rest of the hotel was great as well. We had some drinks and food at the second floor bar that we really enjoyed. And of course, the rooftop bar was outstanding. You can't beat the views from up there.

Again, staff very solicitous; asking how they can help but then they forget to bring what you've requested.    The elevator is like a Ouije board;  it's probably very sensible approach programming elevators where they are needed most.   But much of the time, there isn't service.  From the much vaunted rooftop bar (cover charge $125 per person), we had to walk down two flights to find an elevator.    The maid ran out of toiletries before she got to my room.

I did check in online, however my room was not ready so I went to the front desk and Laurelei provided me with another room with a perfect view. Interestingly if my room I asked for was ready I would not have had to stop by the front desk, a key and room number would have been provided via the Hilton Honors App. The view from my room on the 6th floor was great but if you want to be amazed visit the 21st, 22nd and 223rd floors. This is where we had breakfast and enjoyed a view from the rooftop bar. The line was a little long at happy hour on Friday so I would recommend making the rooftop bar an early stop weather permitting. I only had one problem with this property, the shade in the bathroom was broken and I would have loved the view. The Room was small but perfect for the two of us. The bathroom was large and well lit.

It is conveniently located in the corner of Wacker Drive and Michigan Avenue. Close to the Magnificant mile and State street shopping area, steps from the Chicago river, minutes from the Millenium park and lots of cafes, bars and restaurants around the area. Also close to bus stops, hop on and hop off tour buses, river cruises and the ""L"" train station. The reception desk is on the second floor and the check in process is fast. The staff are polite and friendly. The room is on the smaller side but appears to be big as there's no more bulky TV cabinet and huge writing desk. The bathroom is huge with bathrobe and Malin + Goetz toiletries. I like the Nespresso coffee maker in the room and the complimentary bottled water they handed out upon check in (not sure if this is only for HHonor members). Had an awesome view of the Chicago river, be it day or night, it  gives you the multiple hues/faces of the river. Went up and had some booze on the rooftop bar on the 22nd floor. It has great ambience and of course great views of the city and the lake. They do have a spa and fitness room but unfortunately no swimming pool. I have to mention their high-tech elevators. Type in your floor destination on the keypad in front of the elevator cars and it will let you know which elevator car will open next for you. Once it opened, just go in and it will bring you to your floor. No more keypads inside, just look at the monitor for the status. That's a first for me.

But unfortunately that's where my accolades end.  I am a Hilton Honors member and spend a fair amount of time in Hilton family hotels traveling for business--from Hampton Inns to Doubletrees to Curio properties.  I seek them out wherever I go because they nearly always offer a great experience.  The London House was the exception.  First, I used Hilton's app to check-in electronically and picked what looked to be a fantastic room on the 19th floor.  Upon arrival, a colleague of mine who had also checked in after me using the app, noticed that he had gotten the room I had chosen and I had been relegated to a room on the 17th floor.  Maybe he had more points?  What's the point of letting someone think they are picking one room, only to give them a different room when they arrive?  It creates disappointment where it's not necessary.  Service was also very deficient.  There was no iron in the room (a must for business travelers cramming everything into a carry-on).  The first time I called guest services, it rang about 10 times and no one picked up. The second time I called I got a woman who asked, with a slight hint of condemnation, if I had looked in the closet for the iron.  I assume they have to ask that because many people don't look before calling, but the tone was annoying when I was already starting to run late--and yes, I had looked and there was no iron.  Finally, I called for room service breakfast and specifically asked for hot tea with milk.  It sounds stupid, but most people are pretty particular about how they take their breakfast beverage--nothing fancy for me--just a little milk.  When it arrived the water was tepid and there was honey but no milk.  With service charge and tip already included, a yogurt parfait, english muffin, and a tepid tea was $41.  Understandable for room service in a big city, but at that price, please get it right.  This is not the Hilton I know and love--but it does have great potential so I hope they can work out the service kinks.",,5.0,2.0,5.0,,,August 2016,Traveled on business,17,52.0

The first room which was ready on time, the luggage was lost for almost two hours.  it was delivered to the wrong room.  The third room was nice when it was available.

Cons: We had guests in the room next door have an all out brawl. Slamming into walls, bleeding, screaming bloody murder. This happened after 2 AM. We called down and it took someone 30 minutes to come up, by this point I'm sure many people called down. This was the worst fight I've ever heard, let alone in a nice hotel. They were banging into our door and shared wall. Girls were screaming bloody murder, guys were yelling at each other. Sounded like there were much more than 4 people, how did they all get in without security questioning? Why did the response time take so long? Took another 30 minutes for security to successfully get them out. Was almost 4 AM by the time this was settled, by this point our anxiety was through the roof. Hotel was apologetic after going downstairs the next morning, said they were actually going to reach out to us and comp our room before my husband came down. I had to be up at 6 AM, did not get any sleep at all. They were conscious of this and didn't put anyone next to our room for the additional nights we were staying. I went upstairs for the hotel breakfast to grab a banana and coffee after my run, was handed a receipt for $26 (plus tip = $30) for the ""Continental Breakfast"". When I asked for a bottle of water to take, she tried to charge me an additional $5. I left the water bottle and paid the $30 for my banana and average coffee. Spa was just alright, booked a massage (wasn't asked which kind upon booking) and an upgraded ""$30 - 15 foot and leg"" described as ""Calves and feet are massaged with a stimulating peppermint balm and then cocooned in steaming hot towels to wake up tired"" since I'm currently marathon training I wanted some extra TLC. $30 on top of the $120 massage. ""Upgrade"" was a complete ripoff, I'm very uncomfortable saying something when it's happening, but I was really disappointed I paid $30 (plus extra tip) to have about 5 minutes of a mediocre foot rub with no touching of the legs/calves, no ""cocooned towel wrap"". Massage was average, way overpriced. Left pretty irritated. Elevators shut very quickly and left my husband or me on the other side, not even giving us a moment to walk in before shutting the other person on the floor behind. No buttons, so you can't even stop it. Closed on a bunch of guests trying to leave breakfast, took over 10 minutes for us to be able to go downstairs.",,,3.0,5.0,5.0,,August 2016,Traveled as a couple,73,19.0

It is an older building, so there were a few things out of their control like space to pull up, upon arrival and the location of the front desk. Can't complain too much though, it's Chicago. It is a crowded and busy city. When you pull up, there is limited space and time for you to park and give your keys to a valet. Arrival is always stressful. However, the bellmen and valet were helpful and friendly. Also, the hotel front desk is on the second floor. It would have been very confusing, but they had an attendant there to greet you, make your elevator selection and answer any questions we had. Once on the second floor, you'll find the front desk and a very nicely decorated lobby and bar. Loved it. The elevators are very advanced... you make your selection on a touch screen and it tells you what elevator to proceed to. There are no buttons inside the elevator... so cool. Rooms are very nicely   decorated and come with a Nespresso machine and pods to use for free. Bathrooms are roomy and nice, good showers, high tech toilets, clean!

I arrived early and was able to check into the room at about 11:30am.  They would have given me a Bette room had I waited a bit but I need to get into the room to get ready.  It was a 6th floor room, no view to speak of but I was warned that would be the case with the early check in. The elevators don't operate traditionally so don't be surprised when there are no buttons inside the elevator. You need to enter your floor outside the elevator and then it will tell you which elevator to go to.  Then once in the elevator it will stop at the requested floors. On the inside of the door there is a small display of you want to check the floors.  The room was a king which was quite comfy. It was really just the bedroom with a small noon with a desk and chair.  The TV was on the large side.  The bath room was nice with a decent size shower.  The hotel has a european / modern feel to it.  The location is great.  Easy access to Michigan Ave and State Street and right next to the Chicago River.  For the Hilton family hotels it is definitely in a different genre than the Hampton/HGI/Embassy etc.  I had lunch at the 2nd floor bar, a nice salad with tuna. We also had room service breakfast as we missed breakfast on the 21st floor.  Room service at hotels is always expensive.  We had an omelette, lox/bagel, side bacon, 1 coffee, 2 waters, literally $85.  We didn't get the chance to check out the roof top bar which has to be nice but I've read is a ""place to be seen"" kind of place.  Would stay here again if the price is right.  Happen to get a good deal for this Saturday night so took a shot on this hotel.  My stays are usually for a night or two coming from the suburbs so we are usually out and about and not using many of the hotel amenities.

It absolutely didn't disappoint, and we'll be excited to return.  The front desk staff was very welcoming, and upgraded us to a river view suite for our stay, even sending up some chocolates and a couple bottles of sparkling water.  The rooms are very well decorated and designed. Soundproofing seems to be very good, as I couldn't hear hardly any noise from other rooms or the hallway.  I do recommend traveling with ear plugs regardless, and still found them handy, as you're in the city, so you do get the occasional emergency vehicle noise from the street below.  The bed was comfortable - not my absolute favorite, and I wasn't an enormous fan of the pillows, but we're all a little different in our preferences along those lines, so I can imagine others have very much enjoyed both.  Either way, it wasn't a deal-breaker for me by any means.  I slept well both nights.  I enjoyed the new, large TV with it's modern, Smart TV technology, and the bathroom light that detects your presence is a nice feature for nighttime visits.  We also enjoyed the Nespresso machine, which was better than the average in-room coffeemaker.  It did take me a bit to find the instructions for how to use it, but they are simply picture instructions on the box that contains the coffee, sugar, creamer, etc.The location (on the corner of Michigan and Wacker can't be beat).  Views from our room were outstanding (and from LH22 are even better).  The fitness center is well-appointed and was a joy to use (though it would be fantastic if they could put some instructions up on how to use the core training equipment).  The continental breakfast (complimentary for HHonors Gold level guests) was generous if defined as continental.  We enjoyed it.  The gentleman running the omelet station was phenomenal...very friendly and quick.  Most everyone at the hotel was super friendly, and provided excellent customer service.  We had wonderful encounters with the front desk, concierge, girl at the baggage storage/valet area...who loaned us an umbrella (she was wonderfully friendly - and a lifesaver with that umbrella as it turned out).  The server at breakfast wasn't as warm as others, but who knows...it could have been an off-weekend for her (I couldn't justify a tip on the 2nd day - my apologies to her if she was just feeling off and could have benefited from that as a pick me up).  I will say; however, that with the exception a couple individuals in the breakfast area, I did detect a different feel up on the 21st and 22nd floors.  Perhaps a little more pretentious...and just not as welcoming...so combined with other reviewers saying they had a much worse experience, I'd say that's an area of opportunity for the hotel.  I also want to highlight one ""negative"" of sorts that we experienced.  It involves the in-room refrigerator.  I put negative in quotes, and I don't take away from my rating of this property, because I felt it was a bit of a bonus that they had a refrigerator of any kind, but the design of this particular refrigerator is questionable at best for me.  The name on the front of the unit is ""SmartFridge"", but it seems to be anything but...technology for the sake of technology, but not aiding in utility if you will.  It has several buttons to turn the unit on and off, change the view from celsius to fahrenheit, and a quick cool button...all fine and good.  I'm not sure of the need to turn your fridge on and off (just unplug it perhaps?), but the owner's manual I found online claims it is so guests don't have to hear the condenser running at night if they don't want to.  It's not loud...but anyway, the reason I looked the unit up was because it wouldn't stay below 41 degrees fahrenheit.  I played with the buttons, trying to find a way to set the temperature, but to no avail.  The owner's manual states that the unit is set to cool to 41 degrees...the quick cool will take it to 34 degrees, but then it returns to its normal operating temperature.  This is a lengthy note about this topic, but I bring it up because many of you probably know that perishable items should be kept at 40 degrees or below, so the fact that it will not stay at that level makes it useless for leftovers, milk (which we ended up throwing away), etc.  It's a wonderful bonus to have in the room for your non-perishable beverages - soda, wine, water, beer, etc...and works well for chocolates and the like, but it's a shame that it was designed neglecting good food safety.  Anyway - the length of that ""negative"" wasn't indicative of our overall feel of the stay.  We loved basically everything about this hotel, and we will be excited to return and use it as a home base for exploring the city of Chicago.",,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,August 2016,Traveled as a couple,150,55.0

It is in the middle of the bustling downtown area of Chicago and is right on the river. It is virtually in striking distance to all the notable things to visit in Chicago and it is in walking distance to many of the top restaurants in the city. The entire hotel represents a complete renovation of a historic building in Chicago and it doesn’t disappoint. The street level has a very nice dual bank of elevators. There is no guessing as to what elevator will open its doors as you specify the floor and a digital display tells you what elevator will take you there. Registration is on the second floor and it is very swanky and richly appointed. Service is very professional, friendly and efficient. The rooms are well decorated with an accent on minimalism. The view I had was of the Chicago River and the many bridges and buildings that pepper the landscape. The air conditioning system was highly effective and extremely quiet and great if you are a light sleeper. There were ample plugs for your computer or accessories.When you stay at the LondonHouse Hotel make sure visit the roof top terrace known as LH On 22. You can take in a great meal, your favorite cocktail and enjoy the wonderful elevated view of Chicago. Be certain to make your reservations in advance of getting to the hotel as it is a popular place.I had room service the very first day as I was just too tired to go out and I have to say that the food was actually delicious. Lastly, I would like to praise two of the managers of the LondonHouse Hotel, Carlos and Keith, for being completely devoted to customer service by taking care of a couple of things for me and making sure that my experience was nothing but the best.

Being a Hilton Honors Reward Member, we were pleasantly surprised to find LondonHouse. Each and every employee that we came in contact with treated us like royalty. The views of Chicago were endless, with her skyline and river taking center stage. Seeing this beauty from our crystal clear floor to ceiling windows in our Vista Suite was postcard prefect. But those views were nothing compared to the scenery that was framed from atop the rooftop bar. Comfy seating and a server willing to track down a favorite cocktail from a bar on another floor made it that much better. The drinks were pricey, but we decided that the view was so worth the cost. Chocolate croissants, freshly sqeezed orange juice, and a personally prepared omlette made for a delicious breakfast. From the decor, to the ammenities, to the placement of the floor mirror (reflecting the river and bridges, we could tell that attention to details were met in our suite. In lieu of the expensive valet parking, consider one of the local parking garages, as they are (relatively) less expensive.

It's a departure from their bland corporate properties and the answer to many of the independent boutiques and the Kimpton Hotels of the world. The location is fabulours, can't get better in fact and occupies a magnificent renovated old office building. The rooms are beautifully appointed and though not large very comfortable. Go for one of the rooms overlooking the river.Hotel service and staff is very nice (kudos to the desk staff and doormen) but their are some faults. The biggest being the rooftop bar which is a must visit but not for the libations. The roof has one of the most stellar views of Chicago as if you can reach out and touch the top of the magnificent skyscrapers (don't bother with the disgusting Trump disaster across the river ;) ). The problem with the bar is the horrendous service and unnecessary attitude. The bar, which I'm guessing is a concession is believing itself to be a hip bar in lower Manhattan rather than a hotel bar their to service first and foremost the guests. The bar gets a large population of local wannabes which I guess accounts for the faux exclusivity of it all. Go up for the view, take some pictures and then go elsewhere for a drink. Theirs much, much better in town.The second fault of the hotel is the buffet breakfast served in the lobby. It's an uncomfortable set up for a full breakfast and a bit awkward especially if you're having a breakfast meeting. I'm guessing that a full service restaurant will open eventually and that the breakfast lobby is a temporary set up until then.PROS:Wonderfully helpful staff hotel staff.Comfortable, well appointed rooms.

Once we figure out where to go, the valet and bellmen were right there. We arrived there way before check in, as our Army daughter had arrived at 5 am and we were anxious to see her, they had a room for us when we arrived at about 12:30. Front desk reception was very friendly and nice. We were given a room with a lovely view of Michigan Ave and the Chicago river on the 16th Floor. Cool elevators that you just inputed the floor you wanted to go to and they send you to that elevator. No buttons in the elevator to push so if you entered the wrong elevator it would not stop at your floor. very inventive. Rooms were also very advanced in lighting and drove my husband nuts because I knew how to do to the dimmers, reading lights, et all. Hotel was just in it's 2nd month of operation. Everything very clean, super comfy beds, cool decor and again an amazing location.

Hotel guests ( and we were attending a wedding of 110 people at the hotel and 1/2 of those were staying at the hotel) could not get up to the rooftop. had to stand in line with everyone else.

I asked to upgrade to a larger room for Sunday, Monday night.  He was so kind to put me in a room that I could have all four nights, without switching, and it was actually less than what I booked online.  My room was beautiful, 12th floor, double, with river views and floor to ceiling windows.  (1203)....  Thank you Bryan, you are the type of employee that keeps me loyal to the Hilton brand!  My next stop was the rooftop.  I went early and had a salad.  I am sure  it gets packed later on, but I had no problem finding a table and the Buratta salad was really good.

Hotel is gorgeous except for very tacky lobby/breakfast area.  Breakfast staff was kind and helpful.  Don't ask for a shower stool they have none.  They will tell you they have built in seats in handicapped rooms.  Only drawers in room are under the beds like in kids furniture. Our room had no surfaces for our belongs other than the small desk between beds. We had 1 desk chair and no others chairs in our room.  The mattresses slide around on platforms.  You can get bruised walking into them. You can only see the back of your head in the bathroom mirror if you can lift a really heavy electric makeup mirror.   Staff in 2 of 3 bars didn't know how to make the drink I ordered and were rude and dismissive, telling me they didn't have the liquer needed even though their bouncer confirmed they did before I entered the bar..  They turn off the elevator from the 21st to 22nd floor roof top bar at night.  If you use a cane, they don't want you up there anyway.  Even after we asked, they didn't service the second room my sisters and I booked so they had no clean towels, soaps, coffee etc.   They have no quarters at front desk should you need change for CTA.   One of our phones quit working.  They told our sisters in the other room that we turned it off and did not want to be disturbed.  We booked at $189.00 a room.  They charged $220.00 or $240.00. You would think that Hilton would have done a better job of customer service, staffing, training and decorating that lobby with their 90 year history in the hotel business.  My sisters and I will look elsewhere for our next Chicago adventure.",,,,,,,July 2016,,21,4.0

The desk/sitting area was separated from the bed (may be the most comfortable Hilton bed I've slept in) by a floor to ceiling divider that also contains the television on a pivot (opposing side is a mirror) so you can rotate it depending on which side you are on. Master light switch by the door and the bathroom light switch has a motion setting and the shower has a Kohler rainhead (awesome). The mini fridge has LED lighting and a digital temp control (nice touch) and there is also a Nespresso machine (note that a The Corner Bakery is also on the first floor and is very good too). Lobby on the second floor also has an open bar with nice view of Wacker and the river and a rooftop bar on the 21st floor has excellent views.

I'm currently in my second trimester of pregnancy and arrived early hoping to check in a little early due to some morning sickness. I made the person who originally helped me aware of my circumstances and let him know I would be sitting in the lobby waiting until there was a room available. The bar in the lobby is nice, yet severely overpriced (IMO) for quality and quantity. I opted for for some iced tea that cost (with tip) almost $8. Having said that....hello Chicago. After two hours of not hearing a room was available I checked back in with the front desk to see if a room was available and it still was not. I chose to get some fresh air as my husband was still at a meeting for work and by this point in time I felt like I was going to get sick. After a hour or so, I went back and meet up with Carlos (works at the front desk), whom was sensitive to the way I was feeling. He was a Godsend to me. He personally went to make sure my room was available and checked me in. I was beyond excited to rest upon a bed. Our room was a Corner King Suite with views of Mich Ave. as well as the river. Fabulous size. Comfortable beds (but scratchy sheets), Nespresso machine with three choices of Joe, but no tea options (#preggoissues). The bathroom was a nice size and the shower had great pressure and was huge (relatively speaking for chi- hotel standards). The toiletries were lovely. TV and mirror wall interchanged from bedroom to living room space should you so wish. We loved our room. So long as the price was right, we'd stay here again.

The hotel is lovely and it's an excellent location, right off the Magnificent Mile.  If you're lucky you'll get a room off the river where you can watch the boats go down as the water glimmers at night. The rooms are very nicely appointed and the bedding is crisp and comfortable. The grey tones the rooms are decorated in are hip but tasteful and the dupioni silk drapes in dark grey provide a very soothing backdrop.  The bathrooms are functional and aesthetically welcoming.  The clean style offers lots of space for sundries. The tile is quite pretty and the wall paper is very cleverly done in a style that mimics a high end shimmery tile. The showers are large and the shower heads provide a very comfortable soaking.  The staff is really warm and very informative and helpful.  And the elevators are speedy and quiet. So what's the problem?  Our first room had a very odd problem.  The bathroom had wiring issues. The fan kept going on and off seemingly of its own accord and the lights went on and off as well.  We called down to have it attended to but no one was able to fix the problem and it kept us up for quite a while. During the summers Chicago hotels can be hard to come by and very pricey so I was very glad that as Hilton Honors members we got a very good rate both times but our first room was small and a bit oddly laid out.  For a single person it would have provided some very welcome separate areas to organize living space but it was a bit cramped for my husband and me. Our second room was far more spacious and nicely laid out and no issues with the bathroom wiring but the room faced away from the river and the traffic noise was a bit loud despite being on one of the upper floors.  Nonetheless we had a nice stay overall.  You couldn't ask for a better location and the halls were extremely quite and the room remarkably clean.  We'll definitely be staying there again.  It's a newly renovated hotel and I'm sure they'll be working out the little quirks and kinks over the autumn.",,,,,,,July 2016,Traveled as a couple,111,46.0

We found a table across from the bar and helped ourselves for a bit. It's atmosphere is the perfect spot for some sun-worshiping and cocktails in the late afternoon. We sat for a bit and really enjoyed the mildly swanky but unpretentious environ. We waited a bit, chatted a bit, and I then took my camera out of my bag to take a pic of the view of the river. I squeezed the shutter twice before a manger appeared at our table.  ""Excuse me sir..."", he politely explained that my camera was too professional, and I would have to pay a fee if I wanted to take pics of the view from the roof.  Now... I really did come to the roof for a few drinks, and I really did not feel like getting into a discussion about exactly how one can copyright the light particles that come from outside of a property inward, and how those can prohibited from capture ... especially as I was there as a paying customer...... but that's beside the point.  I asked his forgiveness in exchange for putting my camera away. He agreed cordially, and excused himself.  It was at this point that he turned around, looked at our table, and asked ""Has anyone taken your order?""""No"" I said, ""you're the first person here to speak to us.""He was exactly as embarrassed as he needed to be, returned with water and menus, and promised a server would appear soon.  We had a few drinks and forgot about it, then excused ourselves to our room - where we ran into a similar issue getting the wifi to work.....  but it will be beautiful!

After I'm all settled and took the smart elevator up, unfortunately it was pouring raining that night and 22F is closed. Also, it was very loud on 21F, given it's a club. When I finally sat down at the 2F lounge, it's almost 9:40 and I waited for 15 minutes without anyone asking me for orders or drinks. I walked outside to dine somewhere else instead.

The staff and common areas exceeded our expectations. The evening rooftop experience was missed due to a conflict with availability and a previous commitment, but we were able to ""walk in"" for mimosas on Saturday morning to take in the view. It is spectacular to say the least.We had a corner studio on the 19th floor (1933) that had a couple of issues. The fan in the bath was not operating during our stay. No big deal. A bigger deal was the air conditioning unit/fan located in the ceiling adjacent to the sleeping area. It seemed to be incapable of operating for more than a minute or two and was LOUD during the activation and shutdown. Perhaps that's because the thermostat was on the wall directly in the path of the airflow. Kicked on and off continuously both day and night sounding, each time, like a car traveling across a metal - grate bridge. (No, we didn't complain. First night arrived so late due to airline delay that a hurricane wouldn't have disturbed us - busy during the day before the second night and forgot to mention it before leaving. By the time we settled in for our second night it was too late to expect any remediation, if otherwise possible. Our mistake!)Only other issue is that I have yet to receive our electronic invoice despite being informed at check out it was being sent at that precise moment, and again 4 hours later when I called to report that it had not been received.

Overall, we had a disappointing stay due to service issues and slow elevators.  The hotel has a cool look but the constant service issues/slow elevators masked the novelty of the hotel.  We arrived for a 3 pm check-in on Friday and after a two 1/2 hour wait the front desk finally found us a room.  The room we booked online was supposed to have floor to ceiling windows - we ended up with a brick-wall view and a weird interior window that separated the bedroom from the living room.  They did provide Breakfast vouchers for the delay but the morning continental spread was very sparse and wasn't refilled and we couldn’t find a service attendant.  The rooftop offers an amazing view but you'll have to be tolerant due to the elevator system that can be very slow during peak hours.  During checkout we had to dispute our bill since they charged us for parking and we didn’t park at the hotel.

It was a very good hotel, and the location was perfect along the river.  Room 1848 had a small view of the river, and a window in the bathroom with a rolling shade for privacy.  The lack of light at night was disappointing in the room; I felt it was too dark especially in the rooms hallway...which had three Good size Windows in the daytime for light.  The room was pretty clean, and the hotel just opened a few months before our stay.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  I will say the most disappointing part of the stay was the breakfast.  compared to other Hilton properties I've stayed at overseas, the breakfast was very very small.  Luckily it was complementary for me as a member, but it is not worth the money if you had to pay for it.  They had a small breakfast station set up at the bar and an omelette station.  The seating in the bar area was not comfortable for breakfast or eating at.  I can see the look they are going for, but eating there for breakfast to me felt uncomfortable and the selection was very small for the price if paid for.  The location of the hotel is right across from the major bus tour companies.  When you walk outside the hotel you can see the Chicago Tribune and Trump buildings.  Overall, it was a great stay and I would consider staying at this hotel again.  It is very new, nice looking, and the staff is friendly.

Unlike the vulgar 17 foot sign on the Trump Tower directly across the river, LH added only a discreet sign on the historic building along with a small metal canopy with sign on the new addition.The exterior rooftop lounge and bar with its deep views of the Chicago River on both sides, including a partial view of Lake Michigan on the other, is a dazzler and a must-see, although often not immediately available because of the long lines.Perhaps guests could be given priority access by showing the room entry card?Oddly, the original building entrance is no longer being used, although it has two highly informative paintings describing the immediately adjacent river as being the original port of Chicago and the busiest on the Great Lakes. (The port was moved with the addition of two-level Wacker Drive in 1926, and it is now a sophisticated and pedestrian-friendly River walk). Perhaps management will yet open this as an alternate entrance, especially since it is so dramatic.The overall decor is stylishly modern with luxurious patterned and sculptured carpeting especially noteworthy.  Decor in the medium size lobby, which is on the second floor, is also appealing, and the large windows with sensational views add to the first impression.  Friendly front desk with personnel nicely attired and helpful.  Another feature of interest are the 'intelligent"" elevators, from which the floor is tapped-in and one of 6 elevators is shown as being next.  The six elevators from the previous office building era means that an elevator is almost always nearby.  The carpet style continues into the wide hallways and generously appointed guest rooms.  The following refers only to the front facing rooms and not to the interior rooms, which are about one-third of all rooms.  (Views from interior rooms are completely different.)  The views front front-facing rooms are not merely outstanding, they are unforgettable, as powerful as anywhere in Chicago or anywhere in America..  The larger rooms, such as at corners, are practically junior suites with sitting area and desk on one side and then the bed and bath on the other, each separated by what must be the largest HD TV in Chicago, an impressive 55 inch flat screen within an attractive wood patterned frame.  Except that so much is immediately available within steps of the hotel, it is almost a reason to linger longer.  The TV is also interactive with the ability, for example, to stream content from I phone to TV.  A classy vintage look combination radio, alarm and blue-tooth also allows streaming with good sound. Excellent, quiet ventilation and air-conditioning.  Comforters on top-quality mattress, among the best experienced.  Large, bright bath with patterned glass translucent door that slides into a frame from room to the bath also succeeds.In keeping with many new hotels, tubs are no longer a bath feature, but the separate shower enclosure has a wide and inviting shower stream, although the shower enclosure lacks places for towels and face cloths, although the handle suffices.  While the toiletries are good quality and the soap bar, while not especially large, is sufficient, not everyone will agree with the essence or even recognize the name of the brand. (When asked for the name at the spa, the attendant said she didn't know and that the brand was not used in the spa.)  The bath area itself has only one hook for clothing or towels.  A min-fridge and Nespresso machine are thoughtful additions, at least in the front facing rooms, many of which may be higher-priced, but worth it. Another oddity is that no stationery or note pads are in the room. The free wi-fi is also noteworthy, because staying in a deluxe hotel that requires guests to pay extra for wi-fi is as offensive as beachfront or resort hotels charging a ""resort fee"" for the ""privilege"" of using the pool and towels. Avoid them.  As of mid-July 2016, the hotel is about 2 months old, but is already very popular in a city that greets 52 million visitors every year and increasing.  With some fine-tuning, the London House is most certainly a five star hotel and fully capable of competing with the city's other five star properties.  Along life is assured.",5.0,5.0,5.0,,,,July 2016,Traveled as a couple,139,168.0

I've been a Hilton Honors member for a few years now and I decided to go Hilton this time for our last minute stay in downtown Chicago. The chain knocked this one out of the ball park. Here's why: the hotel is in the best location ever. It's on the river, walking distance to everything downtown- Michigan Avenue shopping, the Purple Pig (more on that in another review), the river walk, even Navy Pier and Andy's jazz club...And here's what I loved the most about it: the decor is super design oriented - rooms and lobby are beautifully designed with great attention to detail-  beds are super comfortable- sheets are crisp- the tile design in the bathroom is gorgeous. Hexagon slate colored ceramic tile with lots of amenities and glass and polished dark wood...Clean, high end, with outstanding views of the river and Chicago sky scrapers, all integrated within the bones of a beautiful old hallowed Chicagoan building. I felt like Ferris on his day off even though I'm a girl! Here's what you need to know though. My kids are teenagers. This isn't a place for the littles. There is an on trend bar on the roof top which sports amazing city light views. You are on top of the world here, nestled amongst the colored lights of the adjacent skyscrapers with movers and shakers. Our first night my husband and I took the digital elevator ride (don't even ask or this will ruin the fun- It felt like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory in a very bad way) up to the top and we had a romantic nanosecond under the summer skies while we left our moron kids to duke it out in the room. But the next night when we returned, there was a line to the elevator replete with arm crossed bouncers and a gal with a clipboard asking if we were on the list. I'm just saying! Turns out (from an adorable girl at Nordstrom's) - London House is the new night time hot spot in downtown Chicago. Oh, and one last thing: if you happen to have a car, which is ill advised in downtown Chicago under any circumstances- but we did - please know that parking is $70 per night. Sticker shock at first - but parking is in and out all day so it was what it was, as we needed a car for our stay.  Valets were very accommodating- apart from one I wanted to punch in the mouth. Ha!

I've stayed at many hotels in Chicago but this hotel is definitely top notch!  The views are unbelievable! We showed up at the lounge and had not made a reservation.  We spoke to one of the staff members and explained our dilemma. They introduced us to Leonidas Fronimos and we explained to him our dilemma again. He was attentive and accommodating.  He was able to get us a table and made sure to have staff bring us our drinks quickly.  We were so grateful for his accommodations. Through out the night he checked in on us. Before we left he asked us for our contact information and if there was anything else he can be of assistance during our trip.  We thanked him and said he had already gone above and beyond.  I didn't expect much but a few days later we received an email from Leonidas.  He asked about our trip and invited us back when we were in Chicago again.  The hotel and staff are excellent.

The river view is beautiful!The staff at this hotel is okay. Not friendly, but pleasant enough to be polite. We were given misinformation by the front desk twice just after our arrival, so we were not confident about their knowledge of the hotel & it's operation.   Hotel guests are given priority access to the rooftop bar. If you plan to go up, I recommend a reservation. It is a small space with a nice view, but not worth waiting in line. The breakfast is weird. Fruit, (small cups of diced cantaloupe & honeydew melon), bananas, yogurt, muffins & made to order omelettes  are all included in the breakfast, but you have to pay extra for toast.

The hotel is new and clearly working hard to make a name for itself as a solid choice in Chicago's Loop/Miracle Mile area. I was really impressed during my stay.My room was well appointed and very comfortable. The Internet connection was not what I'd call ""blazing fast"" - if you want to stream content or need to upload/download large files, it's worth the upgrade. The TV was surprisingly large and reception very clear (although being in the heart of downtown I doubt you'll spend much time watching TV).The rooftop bar is really nice and seems pretty popular. The only concern I had is the breakfast service. It is held in the lobby bar area, which is quite small (and loud), and doesn't really offer much comfortable seating for diners. There was a very limited selection of foods - an omelette station, a few bread items, and that was about it. The breakfast was definitely not worth the price.That being said, though, everything else about my stay was excellent and if the pricing remains competitive I'll certain keep the LondonHouse on my shortlist of places to stay when in Chicago.",,,,,,,July 2016,Traveled on business,156,75.0

Oh! And omlette. I always associated that with toast... Nevermind, I guess! Another weird experience happened when I called to ask where I could find our breakfast (because I wasn't informed about it at check-in), the lady who answered kept going on and on about how free breakfast was only for Gold and Diamond members.

There was also a couple housekeeping issues in the bathroom the hotel is new and that's the reason I gave it as many stars as I did I feel like maybe they're still working out the Kinks I did bring up some of these issues to the hotel they did respond but they definitely didn't go out of their way to make anything right it's not a bad Hotel by any means but I feel like it is lacking and both amenities and service hopefully they can improve these things in time.,,,,,,,July 2016,Traveled solo,428,153.0

We were ready to pay the bill but the point of service system had crashed and our bartender had to do everything by hand.  He apologized for the dealy and offered comp breakfast for our troubles.  We thought that was extremely nice.  In the morning we attend breakfast (back in the lobby bar).  It did seem a bit unorganized and hard to find a table (again - small bar area).

Staff is nice; there's a convenient Corner Bakery right outside the front door, so you can grab some breakfast and head north or south on Michigan Avenue. (There are also restaurants within the hotel.) The location can't be beat. Lots of siren traffic at that intersection, so ask for a higher room on the interior if city noise disturbs your sleep.  Some housekeeping wrinkles could be ironed out -- a used bandaid was on our floor, and there was only one, not two, bathrobes stocked in the closet for a double room.

What also led to the elevator frustration is that the staff was using the same ones as guests and after waiting a long time, the elevator arrive only to be crowded with staff and their equipment, and thus the wait continued.

The property is brand new and looks like it. We had a regular room with a king bed. The room was uber luxurious with stunning views of the river and the lake.  The room comes equipped with a Nespresso coffee maker and you can sip delicious coffee while lounging on the ultra comfy bed. We stayed for 2 days and slept like the dead.  The bathroom was huge and also had great views from the window - there is a shade to pull down! The toiletries provided smelled delicious.  We ordered breakfast one morning from room service, prompt and delicious. Now for the LH Rooftop - WOW! Gorgeous views. You must make a reservation online for a table, it's not that large up there.  Drinks were delicious - an Old Fashioned and Gin & Tonics were $16 each - typical for what you will pay on city rooftops. The food was foodie food - delicious and small bites.

But having said that-Great experience! - Not only best location, (You are on the riverwalk, the corner where Michigan Ave and Magnificent mile meet the Chicago river) - beautifully stylish, hip, relaxing - and a sexy roof top bar with an amazing view (stylish party at night) and professional staff (Shannen the concierge was perfectly helpful).

If you want to be loyal to Hilton (for the rewards) and want a holiday in a boutique young modern atmosphere, you couldn't hardly find any options around the Hilton brands.  waldorf astoria and conrad are not the answer usually. Curio gives exactly that. Adding to the face Hhonors club has improved significantly in so many fronts over the recent 2 years - this club is incredibly smart and rewarding.

It tasted great but was definitively strong. It was vanilla, peach, cognac, and sparkling wine I believe. I definitely cannot even explain how amazing the view was on the rooftop.

The elevators use a unique system that entails logging your desired floor on a key pad that then directs you to Elevator A, B, C, etc. The elevators can be slow during busy periods.

I chose the LondonHouse because of it's TripAdvisor rating and being a part of the Hilton network. I stayed for two nights - one for 70k points and the other for 25k points and $125. The location is undeniable - right off the Miracle Mile and Millennium Park. The rooms are super comfy with towels bigger than my own and pillows that seem to multiple overnight. The little touches like the in-room Nespresso machine and brand new Samsung flat panel TV make staying here a treat. The rooftop bar is nice, but as a New Yorker, it is a bit overhyped. I recommend going to the 21st floor, getting a place in the queue and grabbing the first round there then going to the roof for your second round and requisite Instagram photo. Only (minor) gripe is the gym is a little (note: only a LITTLE) disappointing - it has dumbells (up to 50lbs), an egometer, spin bikes and treadmills, but not much more. Therefore, no yoga mats nor medicine balls, but those are easily added. I will look to stay here the next time I am in town.

Bell staff is on point and extremely professional. Room: Fantastic decor, high-end toiletries.  Each room is configured differently based on the historical nature of the building; therefore, if you are staying in a group and needing multiple rooms, the hotel layout does make it challenging to have rooms all on same floor (my only complaint). Our 10th floor room had a stellar view of the river and skyline.  Location: There is a Corner Bakery Cafe and a Starbucks on the same block, extremely convenient. Hotel proximity is fantastic for events at Millennial/Grant Park or Michigan Avenue. It's located above the river walk shops and boat cruises.  Additional thoughts: The rooftop bar has quickly become ""the"" rooftop in Chicago; however, I believe hotel guests should get first rights to reservations.  It's a bit strange you are paying for the hotel and can't use the amenities. The hotel has opened the terrace, without reservations from 12-2 p.m.  If you are not able to secure reservations for the rooftop bar, there is a small terrace (located behind the hotel sign) that you are able to capture an outdoor view of the city.",4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,June 2016,Traveled with friends,33,31.0

The 22nd floor has limited, controlled access and you need a reservation to get in. We were told they were ""sold out""  for months!!!  This would not have been such a disappointment, except we chose this hotel specifically for the  roof top.We had a wonderful view of the river from our room and everything else was 5 star so that mitigated things.

It was one of the best hotel stays I have ever had. Three things, in particular, stood out to me:1.	Cleanliness – The hotel is SPOTLESS. The lobby and elevators are extremely bright and clean, and this makes an outstanding first impression. The hallways leading to each individual room are also clean as a whistle. I sometimes find that the hallways in some hotels can be a little dusty (from all the foot traffic), but the attention to detail in keeping these areas in tip-top shape is a testament to the staff at the hotel. The cleanliness inside of the rooms was also outstanding. You can absolutely tell that this hotel prides itself on cleanliness. There was no dust whatsoever to speak of in my room, the glass shower was spotless (no soapy film, or ground-in dirt on the floor), stainless steel finishes were freshly polished, and you could tell that the windows in the room were recently washed from both the inside and outside. I was truly impressed with the cleanliness and organization of my room. This was easily the cleanest hotel and cleanest room I have ever stayed in. 2.	Hotel Staff – In general, I expect hotel staff to be friendly and accommodating to all guests. The staff at the London House goes above and beyond. The staff at the reception desk immediately make you feel welcome and like a privileged guest. They are extremely helpful and accommodating to any requests you may have. The general atmosphere of the hotel promotes a warm and hospitable feeling, and the friendliness of the staff only increases that feeling. Additionally, there are always staff at the entrance of the hotel ready to help you with your bags, valet your car, give you directions, etc. Even you don’t need assistance with anything, you will always receive a “good morning/good evening sir, welcome back”. Some people may not think this is a huge deal, but it is just one of the little things that is often overlooked. Aside from being so welcoming, the staff at the entrance of the hotel are also an added level of security, giving you some additional piece of mind while coming and going about your business.3.	Rooms – I was pleasantly surprised with how large the standard king rooms are. As someone who spends roughly 90 nights per year in downtown hotels, I am used to their relatively small size (compared to hotels in the suburbs). The rooms at the London House are definitely much larger than what I consider “standard”. Additionally, the design and layout of the room was absolutely perfect, maximizing the space while staying completely functional. It looks like something out of a design magazine – nice wood fixtures, granite/marble finishes, stainless steel accents, and dimmable inset ceiling lighting. Each room also comes with a wall mounted 55 inch tv at the foot of the bed. The bathrooms were also a welcome surprise. The new fixtures, cleanliness of everything (as well as being larger than normal), all made it a luxury experience. The shower in the bathroom was fantastic - water pressure was fantastic, and had no issues with temperature (staying on the 13th floor, and warm water was instant). Again, this is just one of the little things that makes a difference. Aside from the actual size and layout of the room, one of the unsung features of the room was its windows. The windows in the room are massive, and let in an enormous amount of natural light, and also give you some of the best views of the city and river. The bed was also one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in. My room also had AC that worked perfectly (for the record, it was 95 in Chicago during my stay, and my room was always at a perfect 68). Bottom line - If you are traveling to Chicago on a business trip or for vacation, this is the place to stay. Make your reservations while you can...rooms will surely be in high demand once word spreads about the London House.",5.0,,5.0,5.0,,,June 2016,Traveled on business,1,3.0

That won't matter. Reservations are made via a separate website ticketing system and, as this hotel is brand new, it's completely sold out for the month and expect the rest of summer to be the same. If you pop up in the late afternoon after check-in, they may let you grab a drink and stand around for a bit to enjoy the view--if you don't mind having to stare at tacky DRUMF letters while you sip your cocktail. Hilariously enough, the LH rooftop is actually a few floors ABOVE the DRUMF terrace so you can look down on the DRUMF patrons while you too sip your overpriced cocktail in the sunshine.But seriously, the view is great--I've seen it once now and that's good enough for me.The hotel is definitely nice enough. The room interiors and layout are very similar to the Conrad Hilton London in which we stayed last summer. Functional but a bit cramped. For the money, however, the hotel doesn't have much over any similar price point in Chicago. Chances are you'd choose this hotel over the rest of similar caliber just for the rooftop, but again since being a paying guest will not increase your chances to access, try any other hotel that will. There are plenty in a similar location. PROS:The hotel staff was incredible. Doormen, valet and everyone else in the hotel were great.Huge bathrooms.Nice bath products.Decent views even if you're not facing the river.Chromecast available on the TV.CONS:The LH Rooftop staff. The rooftop clientele.Smallish rooms.No turndown service.No in-room mini bars.Beds are hard.Some noise coming from Michigan Ave. 17 floors up might bother light sleepers.No blackout curtains. Room is super bright in the morning.PARKING TIP: Don’t pay full price valet. LH valet parking is available on Spot Hero for half the price.  No in-and-out, but worth the price.BREAKFAST TIP: Corner Bakery is on the first floor adjacent to the hotel. Order ahead of time with their app and skip the long morning coffee & breakfast lines.",,,5.0,,5.0,4.0,June 2016,Traveled with friends,107,15.0

They were so friendly, positive, and helpful. The front desk, bellmen, housekeeping - you name it. Super nice people proud of their beautiful new hotel. I even met a woman who was learning to stage furniture and fluff pillows at the crazy-popular rooftop lounge and she was so excited. Secondly: well-appointed rooms with comfortable beds, Frette linens and robes, and great desks to get some work in. My room on the 15th floor had beautiful views looking north across the river to the Wrigley building. It was also quiet and restful. Third: location. Convenient to the subway, Metra, and walking distance from most popular tourist spots. Across the street from the must-do Architecture tours and just a few minutes walk to the art institute.

Great Staff.  Great location. Bad Bloody Mary,"Overall experience at this new hotel was great.  From the door men to the front desk to those helping with the elevators to bar/restaurant staff....all very friendly and professional.  Stayed on the 14th floor.  Great view of the river with Trump building across the street.  The location was very convenient to everywhere I needed to be.  Thought the room was modern and comfortable.  Spacious enough.  The only 2 ""negatives"" was that the ""digital key"" they touted didn't work for me.  Not really a big deal but would've liked to have tried it out.  The other was the Bloody Mary.  I know it sounds a little silly, but I really wanted one prior to heading to the airport to catch my flight home.  Rebecca at the bar was fantastic.  Awesome personality and she sincerely tried to help me with an alternative drink.  The Bar Manager or whoever created the Bloody Mary mix certainly lacked creativity or didn't feel like putting a lot of effort into it.  Seriously...embarrassing.  Either get a good mix like Zing Zang (which is from Chicago area btw), make the effort to create a good in-house mix, or simply don't offer one.  Taking tomato juice, adding sugar and Worcester sauce doesn't make a good Bloody Mary mix.  Okay...there you have it.  Absolutely loved the LondonHouse Chicago...except for the Bloody Mary :).

The decor is nice but pretty much what you'd expect for an upscale but not top of the line hotel (with the exception of the truly ugly armoire/closet). If I had wanted to spend any significant amount of time in my room and awake it would have felt very small.  The gym is functional. Just to see what all the fuss was about I went up to the rooftop bar. Even though I didn't have a reservation the host was very nice and let me go up for a look.

It looks very promising, and I can see it will be one of the hottest in Chicago in the future. The decor is upscale and modern. I stayed in the corner room in a low floor. Really beautiful room, very comfortable bed, huge TV (at least 60""), nice views, and a Nespresso machine.I have to say, it gets noisy sometimes, and I'm a guy who is usually not bothered by noises, so light sleepers beware, make sure you get a high floor. And I'm sorry to say this, but the shower sucks. The flow is weak and the heat is not great. Also, the faucet is confusing. It's a well-known fact that two faucet knobs is a bad design. You make it worse when you remove indications. Which one is hot? Which one rotates anti-clockwise? I'll leave you the thrill of figuring this out. The lighting system is confusing as well. Slow response, and lots of buttons around the room. When I say confusing, it's not like lost-in-a-forest confusing, I mean it's inconvenient and requires some time of getting used to it. Finally, visitors should note that the elevators are not like the conventional ones. You type which floor you're going, and then the screen tells you which elevator to go. The only problem here is that there are six elevators, and still they manage to be really slow (relative to other hotels). The elevator never comes quickly.All that aside, these little things didn't really bother me, and I wrote them here just to let the visitors know. I'll still give this hotel 5 stars. At least they make a very nice omelet.",,,,,,,June 2016,Traveled solo,662,175.0

The staff are so friendly and so helpful. The views are gorgeous, the bed is comfortable, the shower is fantastic. This hotel is in the perfect location to walk to Michigan Avenue, take a boat tour, or just be in the city. My stay here has been the best experience I have ever had.

Upon check-in one of the managers informed us that we were probably the first ones to sleep in the bed in our room!The staff was impeccable.  Check-in was a breeze & the concierge helped us with late reservations to Harry Carey's.Right at the corner of Wacker & Michigan the location is excellent.   I mean you are litterally across the street from the Wendella boat tours, and less than a block from the Magnificent Mile.  An Uber ride from the airport without hiked up fees will cost you about $25. Our 8th floor room overlooked the intersection right down into the river at the Tribune & Wrigley buildings.  So, rooms on this side do give you some outside noise.  If you're a really light sleeper, you'll hear the boat horns and sirens.  But you'll be downtown anyway so you might want to ask for higher floor or something away from this busy intersection.The rooms come with Nespresso machines!  the bathrooms are a comfortable size with the showers actually having glass doors as opposed to curtains.  There are armoire's but no chest of drawers.  Actually, the drawers are in the night stands and underneath the beds.  Also, each room comes with a smart refrigerator that only operates if you put something in it.  Big HD screen TV's are in each room as well.So, as with most things brand new there are some hiccups they are trying to work out.First, our room didn't have any cream or coffee cups to enjoy the nespresso machine our first morning.  So, I go down to the lobby and see a spread of muffins, fruit, yogurt, plates, silverware and coffee urns. So I help myself.  Well, it's not free - even though it sure looks like a help yourself.  Even though nobody hassled me it was a little strange.  However, the panoramic view from the hotel lobby while you sip on coffee is outstanding!The LondonHouse has a fabulous rooftop bar!  Or so, I've heard.  Unfortunately, nobody informed us, upon check-in, that reservations are required and you HAVE to do them online.  We weren't the only ones though.  Several people got turned away like us only to be offered the indoor bar on the top floor which, if I'm going to pay alot for a drink and get slow service, I'd rather do it with a spectacular view!  Note to Londonhouse:  if you start excluding paying hotel customers from this I just don't see how it will be successful.But, if you're not into rooftops, bars or drinks then none of this will probably matter to you.Well, they've really started off well here and I will certainly take a look at this hotel on future visits to Chicago!",5.0,,5.0,,,4.0,May 2016,Traveled as a couple,435,215.0

Initially ordered a king corner room.  Very nice room.  Well decorated, large and good views.  When checking in mentioned our anniversary and when we returned to room found complimentary sparkling wine on ice.  While this was very nice it was 6 days after they opened and this room had some fatal flaws including HVAC that did not work.  Try to call customer services but phone in room was not wired.  Using my cell phone did get customer services and they compensated for our anniversary problems with an upgrade to a King Vista Suite which had a truly spectacular view up the river and plenty of room.  Great bed, Great room, great service.  Nothing like the view from 22nd floor roof top view.  Truly spectacular.",,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,May 2016,Traveled as a couple,12,2.0
